# Shell 2b.3: Notifications and Tray in athanor-bar Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** The bar shows notifications and the tray. Notification popups appear at the panel's end corner, and a notification list with do not disturb opens from the bar. The tray host shows StatusNotifierItems, and their dbusmenu menus open as popovers. Both talk only to `athanor-shelld`, and a peer that is absent or refuses shows nothing (SH1).

**Architecture:**

- **Parsers of peer data are pure Rust in the library**, with no GTK type, and are tested without a display (BR9, "Without a display"). There are four modules:
  - `notices.rs`: the private wire type, cleaned text, bounded pictures, grouping, the held list;
  - `popups.rs`: which popups show and their countdowns;
  - `tray.rs`: StatusNotifierItem properties;
  - `dbusmenu.rs`: menu layouts, with depth and node bounds.
- **GTK draws, in one file per module.**
  - `ui/notifications.rs` holds the service (the private interface of `athanor-shelld`) and the list popover.
  - `ui/popups.rs` holds the popup layer surface.
  - `ui/tray.rs` holds the tray host and its buttons.
  - `ui/menu.rs` turns a dbusmenu layout into a `gtk4::PopoverMenu`.
- **One service per bar, not per surface.** The notification service and the tray host are owned by `Bar`, built once with `Rc::new_cyclic`. Each surface's module widget reads them on `refresh`, so two outputs never mean two `List` calls.
- **D-Bus goes through gio**, as `logind.rs` and `accessibility.rs` already do. The bar does not link `athanor-shelld` and gains neither zbus nor tokio.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2021, gtk4 0.11 (`v4_18`), gtk4-layer-shell 0.8, glib/gio 0.22, gio-unix 0.22, libc (workspace). Tests use:

- `cargo test` in the rig's build stage;
- cosmic-comp in the rig for the captures and two end-to-end runs;
- python3-gobject (Gio) for a fake notification service and a test StatusNotifierItem with a dbusmenu menu;
- the dev VM for the admitted path.

**Spec:** `docs/architecture/doc_bar.md` rev 1:

- BR1 (the sender check, the unicast signals, the respawn);
- BR3 (Notifications, Tray);
- BR4;
- BR5;
- BR6 (Stacking: "At most one popover of the bar is open at a time; opening one closes the other. While a popover of the bar is open, the notification popups on that output are hidden and new ones wait");
- BR9;
- section 5, items 9, 10, 11, 13 (the hook only), 17 and 18.

Read it with `docs/architecture/doc_shell.md` rev 5: stage 2, section 8, and SH13 (12 cases per scene: scale {1.0, 1.5} × {light, dark} × {en, de, rtl}; a popover scene starts with the popover open).

**Where 2b.3 sits.** Package 2b is delivered in five plans, each ending in working, tested software:

| Plan                 | Delivers                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2b.1                 | `athanor-unit`, `athanor-shelld`: notifications server, tray watcher, private interface, unit, package, rig and dev-VM tests                                                                                            |
| 2b.2                 | `athanor-bar`: layer surface per output, the three presets, Landlock, unit; the compositor modules (launcher, app library, workspaces, tiling, accessibility, running apps, input source), the clock and the power menu |
| **2b.3 (this plan)** | the notification popups and list, the tray host and dbusmenu, in the bar                                                                                                                                                |
| 2b.4                 | network, Bluetooth, audio, battery modules on dbusmock fixtures (confirms the Fedora 43 templates, BR9 and open doubt 4)                                                                                                |
| 2b.5                 | the shield and its sheet, the BR8 signals and the notifier change. Needs PR #64 (`athanor-trust-state`, the notifier) below the stack                                                                                   |

This plan brings 3 of the 15 scenes of BR9, which is 36 of the 180 surface cases: the notification popups, the notification list and the tray menu. With 2b.2 that makes 9 scenes and 108 cases.

**Rulings this plan makes.** The spec leaves these open, or says something the model cannot do yet:

1. **The wire decode is pinned to the literal signature** `(usssa(ss)ybbsssuuayuu)`. The bar does not link the `athanor-shelld` crate (zbus, tokio). A test that puts a distinct value in each of the 16 fields pins their order on both sides: `the_sixteen_fields_keep_their_order` in `notices.rs` decodes the table, and a test of the same name in athanor-shelld's `wire.rs` serializes its struct with the same table and reads it back as the bar's tuple. The fake service of the rig uses the same string.
2. **The popup surface names no output; the compositor chooses one.** BR4 says "on the output of the active workspace". `model::Workspace` does carry `output` and `active`, but every output has an active workspace, so the phrase means the focused output, and the compositor client does not expose which output has the focus. The intent is the focused output; cosmic-comp maps a layer surface with no output on the output it considers active. That is open doubt 3, checked by the captures and the dev VM.
3. **Any open bar popover hides every popup and pauses every countdown.** BR6 says "on that output". The popups sit on one output and the popover on another only with two outputs, and the rule stays simple. The list popover is one of those popovers, so opening the list hides the popups.
4. **The pointer over the popups pauses every countdown**, not only the one under it. The popups show as one stack.
5. **Popups beyond the first three keep counting** while they wait. "+N waiting" is a count, not a queue with a time budget: a notification that expires while waiting leaves only the list.
6. **A transient notification whose popup ends for any reason** (expiry, do not disturb, eviction, a popup never shown) is closed as Expired (reason 1). BR4 keeps transient notifications out of the list.
7. **The bar cleans the text and bounds the images again**, although `athanor-shelld` already did. The daemon is a peer, and the parser does not trust it (BR9: unit tests for every parser of untrusted input).
8. **An `image-path` or `app_icon` file is shown only if it is a PNG of at most 1024 × 1024 and 1 MiB.** Its type is checked before it is opened, so a FIFO or a device node is never opened; it is then opened with `O_NONBLOCK | O_NOCTTY | O_NOFOLLOW` and checked again on the open file, and its header is checked before GDK decodes it. Declared limit: `athanor-bar.service` has `PrivateTmp=yes`, so a picture under `/tmp` (screenshot tools often write there) is not visible to the bar and the card shows the generic icon. It is read on every redraw and not cached (ponytail: cache by path and mtime if it shows up in a profile).
9. **Declared tray limits:**
   - `IconThemePath` is ignored (the icon falls back to the pixmap, then to a generic icon);
   - dbusmenu icons and shortcuts are not shown;
   - the bar draws every dbusmenu itself; `ContextMenu` is called only for an item with no `Menu`, which only the item can draw;
   - `LayoutUpdated` and `ItemsPropertiesUpdated` refetch the whole layout, at most once per 250 ms per open menu;
   - every dbusmenu call has a 1 s timeout, so a slow or hostile item holds a click for at most four calls before the menu is given up;
   - a failing `AboutToShowGroup` is ignored;
   - a scroll sends Plasma's convention (120 per notch, up positive);
   - a lazy submenu whose content arrives only on `AboutToShow` stays as it was when the menu opened;
   - tooltip markup is shown as plain text.
10. **The rig runs a fake of the private notification interface.** The admission rule (the caller's cgroup is `athanor-bar.service`) cannot hold in a container without systemd. The tray scenes run the real `athanor-shelld`, which refuses the bar's `List`, so the Refused path is exercised on every CI run. The admitted path against the real daemon runs in the dev VM (Task 9).
11. **Item 13 is a hook only.** The shield sheet of 2b.5 stacks above the popups through `Bar::popovers_changed`, which this plan adds and calls. The sheet itself is not planned here.
12. **Items 9 and 11 are proven where each can be.** Item 11 (a caller outside `athanor-bar.service` is refused) is already covered by `shelld-e2e` and `shelld-acceptance.sh` of 2b.1; `tray_e2e.py` sees it again from the bar's side, as the refused `List`. Item 9 is proven twice: in the rig (`notifications_e2e.py` kills the bar, `tray_e2e.py` kills `athanor-shelld`) and, for the bar's half against the real daemon admitting the real unit, in the dev VM with the new `notifications-acceptance.sh`.
13. **Signals that arrive before the `List` reply are queued**, at most 256, oldest dropped with a warning, and replayed after the list. `athanor-shelld` sends the private signals only after an admitted `List`, so the queue covers the window between its admission and the reply.
14. **The popups take no keyboard focus** (`KeyboardMode::None`, BR4: a popup never takes the focus). Their buttons work with the pointer and through AT-SPI. From the keyboard, the same notifications are in the list, which the bar's popover makes keyboard-reachable. A notification's default action (a click on its text) has no keyboard path; the list's action buttons do.

## Global Constraints

- English in code, comments, commits and docs. There is no attribution line anywhere and no model name.
- No `|| true`, no `continue-on-error`, and no `let _ =` on a result in non-test code. An error is logged at the right priority or returned.
- `panic = "abort"` on dev and release. No `unwrap`, `expect` or indexing on peer data in non-test code. A parser of untrusted input returns `None` or skips the field; it never panics.
- Names, verbatim:
  - the private interface: bus name `org.freedesktop.Notifications`, object `/os/athanor/Notifications1`, interface `os.athanor.Notifications1`;
  - the watcher: `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` at `/StatusNotifierWatcher`; items: `org.kde.StatusNotifierItem`; menus: `com.canonical.dbusmenu`;
  - the popup layer namespace: `athanor-notifications`;
  - the module ids already in `order.rs`: `notifications`, `tray`.
- The wire type of one notification is `(usssa(ss)ybbsssuuayuu)`: id, app_name, summary, body, actions, urgency, transient, resident, desktop_entry, icon_name, icon_file, image_width, image_height, image_rgba (straight RGBA), timeout_ms, popup_ms_left. `popup_ms_left` is `u32::MAX` while the popup waits for the user and 0 when it shows in the list only.
- At most 3 popups at a time, newest nearest the panel, plus "+N waiting" on the bar's notification button (BR4). The list holds at most 100 (the daemon's `CAPACITY`).
- Popups: `Layer::Top`, anchored to the panel edge and the end edge (right, or left under right-to-left text), margin 8 px, no exclusive zone, `KeyboardMode::None`. Every popup surface calls `layer_guard::require_layer_surface` after `init_layer_shell()`, as the bar surfaces do.
- Never destroy a layer surface whose output left: cosmic-comp 1.8 closes the client. An abandoned popup window is emptied and kept, as `Surface::abandon` does.
- A GTK timer or watch holds a `Weak<…>` and is owned by something `Bar` keeps alive. Nothing may depend on an `Rc` dropped after `activate`.
- A module whose source is absent is not shown (SH1): no service, or a refused `List`, hides the notification button; no watcher, or no item that is not Passive, hides the tray.
- At most one popover of the bar is open at a time (BR6). A tray menu is a bar popover like any other.
- Memory: `athanor-bar` at most 64 MB PSS at rest, with every 2b.3 module loaded (item 17).
- **Before Task 1, merge 2c's Unit A:** `git merge --no-ff shell-2c-dock` (b648f633), then `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar` passes (it now covers `athanor-apps` too). A merge, never a rebase.
- Code goes in the files the File Structure names. Shared files are touched only where it names them: 2b.4 builds on this branch and 2c runs in parallel.
- Never edit `scripts/verify.py`, `forge/config/packages.json` or `docs/architecture/*.md` with the Edit or Write tool: the formatter rewrites the whole file. This plan edits none of them.
- Never prefix a command with `cd`. Run podman, git writes and gh unsandboxed.
- Commit messages follow `git log -10`: `feat(bar): …`, `feat(compositor-client): …`, `test(shell): …`, `ci(shell): …`, `test(devvm): …`.

## Review Focus

1. **The pointer leaves the popups because they hid, not because it moved.** A popover opens under the pointer, or the last popup is closed from its own button. GTK sends no `leave` to a window that hides, so the countdowns would stay paused for good. Reasonable expectation: the popups that come back later count down again. Pinned in Task 6 by `redraw_popups` resetting `pointer_inside` when it hides the window, and by `notifications_e2e.py` (Task 8), whose "Short-lived" popup must end on its own right after the list hid the popups and showed them again. The headless rig has no pointer, so the enter/leave half is left to the whole-package review and to a manual check in the dev VM (hover a popup, open the list, close it: the popup must still end).
2. **Signals that arrive while `List` is in flight**, for example a `Closed` for a notification the list reply still contains, or an `Added` older than the reply. Reasonable expectation: no ghost popup and no lost notification. Pinned in Task 5 by the early queue replayed after `listed`, and in Task 1 by `held_replace_then_close_leaves_nothing` and `arrived_moves_a_replaced_notice_last`.
3. **A hostile picture file**: a FIFO, `/dev/zero`, a PNG that declares 60000 × 60000, a 2 MB file, a relative path or `..`. Reasonable expectation: the bar neither hangs nor aborts and shows the generic icon. Pinned in Task 1:
   - `a_fifo_is_not_read`;
   - `a_device_is_not_read`;
   - `a_png_over_the_side_bound_is_refused`;
   - `a_file_over_the_byte_bound_is_refused`;
   - `only_absolute_clean_paths_are_files`.
4. **An output leaves while popups show on it.** Reasonable expectation: the bar keeps its connection, and the next notification shows on an output still there. Pinned in Task 6 by `Service::output_left` abandoning the window, and exercised by the two-output step of `notifications-acceptance.sh` (Task 9).
5. **A dbusmenu layout that is a bomb**: nesting 20 deep, 2000 siblings, a child that is not `(ia{sv}av)`, a label of 10000 characters. Reasonable expectation: the menu opens bounded (depth 8, 512 nodes, 128 characters) and the bar stays alive. Pinned in Task 4:
   - `nesting_stops_at_the_depth_bound`;
   - `siblings_stop_at_the_node_bound`;
   - `a_child_of_the_wrong_type_is_skipped`;
   - `labels_lose_mnemonics_and_are_bounded`.

**Shared files, for the plans that run beside this one.** 2b.4 builds on this branch and touches `ui/mod.rs` (the `Changed` list, the build match), `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rig.sh`, `bar_session.py`, `cases.py`, `tests/test_cases.py`, the po files, `bar-de.po`, the CSS template and the workflow. 2c's Unit A (`athanor-apps`: the applications row, the favourites store, the openers and `athanor_apps::menu`) is merged into this branch before Task 1 (`git merge shell-2c-dock`, b648f633; see Global Constraints), so every anchor and signature below is the merged tree's. The rest of 2c (`athanor-dock`) may still touch `connection.rs`, `rig.sh`, the workflow, the CSS template and `Cargo.lock`; a later `git merge shell-2c-dock` meets adjacent-line conflicts there at most, since most edits to those files are insertions at a named anchor. One is not: Task 8 Step 3 rewrites `bar_session.py` whole (2b.4 edits it too, and the dock's rig session reuses it through `--client`), which Unit A leaves unchanged. In `ui/popup.rs`, Task 6 Step 4 changes only the bar's three-line `attach` and adds `attach_popover` beside it.

## The helper every task uses

The rig's build image runs cargo. The commands below assume this shell function. Define it once per shell; it is the same image `rig.sh build-bar` uses.

```bash
rig_cargo() {
  podman run --rm --memory 6g --security-opt label=disable \
    -v "$PWD:/repo" -v "$PWD/.scratch/shell-rig:/out" \
    -v athanor-cargo-registry:/root/.cargo/registry \
    -e CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/out/target -w /repo \
    localhost/athanor-shell-rig:build cargo "$@"
}
```

If the image is missing, build it first with `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-image`.

### Task 1: `notices.rs`, notifications as the bar reads them

**Files:**
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/Cargo.toml` (add `libc`)
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs` (add `pub mod notices;`)
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/notices.rs` (code and tests)
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-shelld/athanor-shelld-1.0.0/src/wire.rs` (one test, the other side of the field order)
- Modify: `Cargo.lock` (regenerated by cargo, never by hand)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `athanor_unit::text::{line, lines, is_hidden, NAME_CHARS, SUMMARY_CHARS, BODY_CHARS}`.
- Produces:
  - `pub const WIRE_SIGNATURE: &str`, `pub type Wire` (the 16-tuple), `pub const WAITS: u32 = u32::MAX`, `pub const CAPACITY: usize = 100`, `pub const MAX_ACTIONS: usize = 8`;
  - `pub enum Urgency { Low, Normal, Critical }`;
  - `pub enum Picture { None, Name(String), File(String), Pixels { width: u32, height: u32, rgba: Vec<u8> } }`;
  - `pub struct Action { pub key: String, pub label: String }`;
  - `pub struct Notice { pub id: u32, pub app_name: String, pub summary: String, pub body: String, pub actions: Vec<Action>, pub has_default: bool, pub urgency: Urgency, pub transient: bool, pub resident: bool, pub desktop_entry: Option<String>, pub picture: Picture, pub popup_ms_left: u32 }` (`Clone`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`);
  - `Notice::decode(&glib::Variant) -> Option<Notice>`, `Notice::critical(&self) -> bool`, `Notice::group_key(&self) -> &str`;
  - `pub fn is_icon_name(&str) -> bool` (the tray reuses it), `pub fn is_icon_file(&str) -> bool`, `pub fn read_icon_file(&str) -> Option<Vec<u8>>`;
  - `pub fn groups(&[Notice]) -> Vec<Vec<&Notice>>`;
  - `pub struct Held` (`Default`) with `replace_all(Vec<Notice>)`, `arrived(Notice) -> Vec<u32>`, `closed(u32) -> bool`, `get(u32) -> Option<&Notice>`, `all() -> &[Notice]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the dependency and the module**

In `Cargo.toml`, after the `gtk4-layer-shell` line:

```toml
# O_NONBLOCK for picture files a peer names: a FIFO must not hang the bar.
libc = { workspace = true }
```

In `src/lib.rs`, after `pub mod keyboard;`:

```rust
pub mod notices;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `src/notices.rs` with its tests**

```rust
//! Notifications as the bar receives them from athanor-shelld's private interface
//! (doc_bar.md BR1, BR4). The daemon already cleaned and bounded them; it is a peer all the
//! same, so the text is cleaned and the pictures are bounded again here, and nothing here
//! can panic on what the peer sends (BR9, "Without a display").

use std::fs::OpenOptions;
use std::io::Read;
use std::os::unix::fs::OpenOptionsExt;
use std::path::{Component, Path};

use athanor_unit::text::{self, BODY_CHARS, NAME_CHARS, SUMMARY_CHARS};

/// One notification on the private interface, as `athanor-shelld`'s `wire.rs` sends it.
/// The bar does not link that crate (zbus, tokio): this literal and
/// `the_sixteen_fields_keep_their_order` below, which athanor-shelld's `wire.rs` mirrors
/// with the same table of values, pin the field order.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update the lock file and run the tests**

Run: `rig_cargo check -p athanor-bar` (without `--locked`: it adds `libc` to the bar's entry in `Cargo.lock`), then `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-bar notices` and `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-shelld wire`.
Expected: every `notices::tests` and `wire::tests` test passes. `git diff --stat Cargo.lock` shows one line added, the bar's dependency on `libc`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Lint**

Run: `rig_cargo clippy --locked -p athanor-bar -p athanor-shelld --all-targets -- -D warnings`
Expected: no warning. The functions have no caller outside the tests yet; they are `pub` in a library, so there is no dead-code warning.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add Cargo.lock forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/Cargo.toml forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/notices.rs \
    forge/specs/athanor-shelld/athanor-shelld-1.0.0/src/wire.rs
git commit -m "feat(bar): read notifications from the private interface, bounded and cleaned"
```

### Task 2: `popups.rs`, which popups show

**Files:**
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs` (add `pub mod popups;`)
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/popups.rs` (code and tests)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `notices::WAITS`.
- Produces: `pub const VISIBLE: usize = 3`; `pub struct Popups` (`Default`) with:
  - `show(&mut self, id: u32, ms_left: u32, critical: bool) -> bool`;
  - `remove(&mut self, id: u32) -> bool`, `clear(&mut self)`;
  - `tick(&mut self, elapsed_ms: u32) -> Vec<u32>` (the ids whose popup ended);
  - `end_non_critical(&mut self) -> Vec<u32>`;
  - `visible(&self) -> Vec<u32>` (newest first, at most 3), `waiting(&self) -> usize`, `counting(&self) -> bool`, `is_empty(&self) -> bool`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the module**

In `src/lib.rs`, after `pub mod order;`:

```rust

```rust

  - `pub enum Status { Passive, Active, NeedsAttention }`;
  - `pub struct Pixmap { pub width: u32, pub height: u32, pub rgba: Vec<u8> }` (straight RGBA, like `notices::Picture::Pixels`);
  - `pub struct Icon { pub name: Option<String>, pub pixmap: Option<Pixmap> }`;
  - `pub struct Item { pub title: String, pub id: String, pub status: Status, pub icon: Icon, pub tooltip: String, pub item_is_menu: bool, pub menu: Option<String> }` (`Clone`), with `Item::name(&self) -> &str`;

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests and the linter**

Run: `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-bar tray`, then `rig_cargo clippy --locked -p athanor-bar --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
Expected: the nine `tray::tests` tests pass, and clippy is clean.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/tray.rs
git commit -m "feat(bar): read StatusNotifierItem properties within bounds"
```

### Task 4: `dbusmenu.rs`, menu layouts within bounds

**Files:**
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs` (add `pub mod dbusmenu;`)
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/dbusmenu.rs` (code and tests)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `athanor_unit::text::line`.
- Produces:
  - `pub const MAX_DEPTH: usize = 8`, `pub const MAX_NODES: usize = 512`, `pub const LAYOUT_SIGNATURE: &str = "(u(ia{sv}av))"`;
  - `pub enum Toggle { None, Check(bool), Radio(bool) }` (`Copy`);
  - `pub enum Entry { Separator, Item(Item) }`;
  - `pub struct Item { pub id: i32, pub label: String, pub enabled: bool, pub toggle: Toggle, pub submenu: bool, pub children: Vec<Entry> }`;
  - `pub struct Layout { pub revision: u32, pub entries: Vec<Entry>, pub submenus: Vec<i32> }`;
  - `pub fn parse_layout(reply: &glib::Variant) -> Option<Layout>`: the reply of `GetLayout(0, -1, [])`;
  - `pub fn event(id: i32, name: &str) -> glib::Variant`: the `(isvu)` arguments of `Event`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the module**

In `src/lib.rs`, after `pub mod clock;`:

```rust
pub mod dbusmenu;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `src/dbusmenu.rs` with its tests**

```rust
//! `com.canonical.dbusmenu` layouts as the tray's menus read them (doc_bar.md BR5). The
//! layout is a peer's tree: its depth, its node count and its labels are bounded here, and a
//! node of the wrong type is skipped (BR9). Icons and shortcuts are not read (ruling 9).

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests and the linter**

Run: `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-bar dbusmenu`, then `rig_cargo clippy --locked -p athanor-bar --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
Expected: the eight `dbusmenu::tests` tests pass, and clippy is clean.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/lib.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/dbusmenu.rs
git commit -m "feat(bar): parse dbusmenu layouts within depth, node and label bounds"
```

### Task 5: the notification service and the list

**Files:**
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/notifications.rs`
- Modify (shared): `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs`
- Modify (shared): `system/athanor-compositor-client/src/connection.rs` (`activation_token` becomes `pub`)
- Modify (shared): `system/athanor-style/calmo/templates/surfaces.css.in`, then regenerate `system/athanor-style/calmo/generated/css/*.css`
- Modify (shared): `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/POTFILES.in`, `po/athanor-bar.pot`, `po/en.po`, `po/it.po`; `forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 (`notices::{self, Held, Notice, Picture, WIRE_SIGNATURE, CAPACITY}`), Task 2 (`popups::Popups`); `super::popup::{Popup, switch_row}`; `Client::activation_token(&self, Option<&gio::AppInfo>) -> Option<String>`.
- Produces, for Tasks 6 and 7:
  - `Changed::Notifications`;
  - `pub struct Service` with `pub(super) fn start(bar: &Weak<Bar>) -> Rc<Service>` and the accessors `live`, `dnd`, `notices`, `waiting`, `open_when_listed`; `pub(super) fn dismiss(&self, id: u32)`, `pub(super) fn invoke(&self, id: u32, key: &str)`; `fn changed(&self)`, `fn paused(&self) -> bool` (Task 6 extends both);
  - `pub(super) enum Place { Popup, List }`, `pub(super) fn card(service: &Rc<Service>, notice: &Notice, place: Place) -> gtk4::Box`;
  - `pub(super) fn texture(width: u32, height: u32, rgba: &[u8]) -> Option<gdk::Texture>` (the tray's pixmaps use it);
  - `pub(super) fn app_name(notice: &Notice) -> String`;
  - `pub(super) fn has_icon(name: &str) -> bool` (the tray draws a themed name only when the theme has it);
  - on `Bar`: the field `notifications: Rc<notifications::Service>`, `pub fn popover_is_open(&self) -> bool`, `pub fn open_module(self: &Rc<Self>, module: Module)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Expose the activation token** (Unit A leaves it `pub(crate)` at b648f633; this plan makes it `pub`)

In `system/athanor-compositor-client/src/connection.rs`, the bar needs the token for `InvokeAction` (BR4, "Actions"). Replace:

```rust
    pub(crate) fn activation_token(&self, app: Option<&gio::AppInfo>) -> Option<String> {
```

with:

```rust
    pub fn activation_token(&self, app: Option<&gio::AppInfo>) -> Option<String> {
```

Run: `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-compositor-client` (clippy with `-D warnings`, the crate's tests, and the release build of `cc-probe`).
Expected: clean, and every test passes.

```bash
git add system/athanor-compositor-client/src/connection.rs
git commit -m "feat(compositor-client): expose the activation token to the bar's notification actions"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `src/ui/notifications.rs`**

```rust
//! The notifications module (doc_bar.md BR3, BR4): the service that talks to
//! athanor-shelld's private interface, the card every notification is drawn as, and the
//! list popover with "Clear all" and do not disturb. One service per bar (`Bar::notifications`):
//! the button on every surface reads it, so two outputs never mean two `List` calls.

    Some(Box::new(NotificationsUi { inner, service }))
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Wire the module into `ui/mod.rs`**

Each edit is an insertion at the named anchor.

After `mod logind;`:

```rust
mod notifications;
```

Replace `use std::rc::Rc;` with:

```rust
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};
```

In `enum Changed`, after `Favorites,`:

```rust
    /// The notification service: its state, the list, the popups.
    Notifications,
```

and replace the `ALL` constant with:

```rust
    pub const ALL: [Changed; 7] = [
        Changed::Windows,
        Changed::Workspaces,
        Changed::Keyboard,
        Changed::Accessibility,
        Changed::Favorites,
        Changed::Tick,
        Changed::Notifications,
    ];
```

In `pub struct Bar`, after `open_on_start: Option<Module>,`:

```rust
    /// One service per bar, not per surface: every surface's button reads it.
    notifications: Rc<notifications::Service>,
```

In `start`, replace `let bar = Rc::new(Bar {` with:

```rust
    let bar = Rc::new_cyclic(|weak: &Weak<Bar>| Bar {
```

and after the `open_on_start: …` field initializer (the line `.and_then(|id| Module::from_id(&id)),`):

```rust
        notifications: notifications::Service::start(weak),
```

In `fn build`, after `Module::RunningApps => running::new(bar),`:

```rust
        Module::Notifications => notifications::new(bar),
```

In `impl Bar`, after `popover_opened`:

```rust
    /// A popover of the bar is on screen (BR6, "Stacking").
    pub fn popover_is_open(&self) -> bool {
        self.open_popover
            .borrow()
            .as_ref()
            .is_some_and(|popover| popover.is_visible())
    }

    /// Opens `module`'s popover on the first surface, for the captures of BR9
    /// (`ATHANOR_BAR_OPEN`). A module whose source answers later opens itself then.
    pub fn open_module(self: &Rc<Self>, module: Module) {
        let surfaces = self.surfaces.borrow();
        let target = surfaces
            .first()
            .and_then(|surface| surface.modules.iter().find(|(m, _)| *m == module));
        match target {
            Some((_, ui)) => ui.open(self),
            None => tracing::warn!(
                module = module.id(),
                "ATHANOR_BAR_OPEN names a module the bar does not show"
            ),
        }
    }
```

In `mapped`, replace the whole `glib::idle_add_local_once(move || { … });` block inside `if let Some(module) = self.open_on_start {` with:

```rust
            glib::idle_add_local_once(move || {
                if let Some(bar) = weak.upgrade() {
                    bar.open_module(module);
                }
            });
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The styles**

Append to `system/athanor-style/calmo/templates/surfaces.css.in`, after the `button.bar-confirm` rule:

```css

/* Notification cards (doc_bar.md BR4): in the list, and on the popup surface, which is
 * transparent so that each card floats with its own shadow. */
.notification-card {
    padding: 12px;
    border: ${border_width}px solid @ath_line;
    border-radius: ${radius_card}px;
    background-color: @ath_surf;
    color: @ath_ink;
}

.notification-card.critical {
    border-color: @ath_warn;
}

window.athanor-notifications {
    background-color: transparent;
}

window.athanor-notifications .notification-card {
    margin: 6px 14px 14px;
    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px @ath_shadow_near, 0 6px 18px @ath_shadow_panel;
}

.bar-badge {
    font-size: ${size_small}px;
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

Regenerate and check:

```bash
python3 system/athanor-style/calmo/generate.py css
python3 system/athanor-style/calmo/generate.py css --check
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s system/athanor-style/calmo/tests
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh css-parse
```

Expected: `--check` reports no drift, the unit tests pass, and GTK parses the four stylesheets.

- [ ] **Step 5: The strings**

Add the new source to `po/POTFILES.in`, after `src/ui/mod.rs`. Do not re-sort the file: since Unit A it lists the bar's sources in order and then, last, the two `athanor-apps` sources `../../../../system/athanor-apps/src/openers.rs` and `row.rs`.

```bash
f=forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/POTFILES.in
sed -i '\|^src/ui/mod\.rs$|a src/ui/notifications.rs' "$f"
grep -c '^src/ui/notifications\.rs$' "$f"
```

Expected: `1`.

Regenerate the template and merge it, in the build image:

```bash
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo localhost/athanor-shell-rig:build \
    bash -c 'forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/update.sh \
             && msgen --no-wrap -o forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/en.po \
                forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/en.po'
```

`Close {title}` and `Unknown application` already exist: they come from `athanor-apps`' `row.rs`, which the catalog lists since Unit A. The new messages:

| msgid                            | it                            | de (test catalog)                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Notifications`                  | `Notifiche`                   | `Benachrichtigungen`                 |
| `Notifications, {count} waiting` | `Notifiche, {count} in attesa` | `Benachrichtigungen, {count} wartend` |
| `Do not disturb`                 | `Non disturbare`              | `Nicht stören`                       |
| `Clear all`                      | `Cancella tutto`              | `Alle löschen`                       |
| `No notifications`               | `Nessuna notifica`            | `Keine Benachrichtigungen`           |

Fill `it.po` with this script, which fails on a msgid it does not know. msgmerge may have matched a new id fuzzily against an old one: the script drops the `#, fuzzy` flag and the `#|` previous-msgid lines of the entries it fills.

```bash
python3 - forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/it.po <<'EOF'
import re
import sys

TABLE = {
    "Notifications": "Notifiche",
    "Notifications, {count} waiting": "Notifiche, {count} in attesa",
    "Do not disturb": "Non disturbare",
    "Clear all": "Cancella tutto",
    "No notifications": "Nessuna notifica",
}
path = sys.argv[1]
blocks = open(path, encoding="utf-8").read().split("\n\n")
done = set()
for n, block in enumerate(blocks):
    match = re.search(r'^msgid "(.*)"$', block, re.M)
    if not match or match.group(1) not in TABLE:
        continue
    msgid = match.group(1)
    lines = [
        line.replace("#, fuzzy, ", "#, ").replace(", fuzzy", "")
        for line in block.split("\n")
        if not line.startswith("#|") and line != "#, fuzzy"
    ]
    block = "\n".join(lines)
    blocks[n] = re.sub(r'^msgstr ".*"$', f'msgstr "{TABLE[msgid]}"', block, flags=re.M)
    done.add(msgid)
missing = set(TABLE) - done
if missing:
    sys.exit(f"not in the catalog: {sorted(missing)}")
open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8").write("\n\n".join(blocks))
EOF
```

Append the German test strings to `forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po`:

```bash
cat >> forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po <<'EOF'

msgid "Notifications"
msgstr "Benachrichtigungen"

msgid "Notifications, {count} waiting"
msgstr "Benachrichtigungen, {count} wartend"

msgid "Do not disturb"
msgstr "Nicht stören"

msgid "Clear all"
msgstr "Alle löschen"

msgid "No notifications"
msgstr "Keine Benachrichtigungen"
EOF
```

Check every catalog:

```bash
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" -w /repo localhost/athanor-shell-rig:build \
    bash -c 'for po in forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/*.po forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po; do msgfmt --check --statistics -o /dev/null "$po"; done'
```

Expected: `en.po` and `it.po` each report every message translated, five more than before this task, with no fuzzy or untranslated one; `bar-de.po` passes the check.

- [ ] **Step 6: Build and run the bar's gates**

```bash
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh atspi bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh bar-e2e
```

Expected: clippy, the tests and the release build pass. `atspi bar` still finds its 7 interactive widgets and no problem: the rig has no notification service, so the button is hidden (SH1). `bar-e2e` passes every check as before, and `.scratch/shell-rig/bar-e2e-client.log` has no warning or error line from the notifications module: an absent service is the normal case in that scene and logs nothing above debug.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/notifications.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs \
    forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po \
    system/athanor-style/calmo/templates/surfaces.css.in system/athanor-style/calmo/generated/css
git commit -m "feat(bar): notification list with grouping, clear all and do not disturb"
```

### Task 6: the popup surface

**Files:**
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/popups.rs`
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/notifications.rs`
- Modify (shared): `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs`
- Modify (shared): `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/popup.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 5 (`Service`, `card`, `Place::Popup`, `Bar::popover_is_open`), Task 2 (`Popups::visible`, newest first), `crate::layer_guard::require_layer_surface(&gtk4::ApplicationWindow)`.
- Produces:
  - `ui::popups::Window` with `new(bar: &Rc<Bar>, service: &Weak<Service>) -> Window`, `show(&self, bar: &Bar, service: &Rc<Service>, notices: &[Notice])`, `hide(&self)`, `visible(&self) -> bool`, `abandon(self)`;
  - on `Service`: `pub(super) fn pointer(&self, inside: bool)`, `pub(super) fn redraw_popups(&self)`, `pub(super) fn output_left(&self)`;
  - on `Bar`: `pub fn popovers_changed(&self)` — the hook item 13 asks for; 2b.5's shield sheet calls it too (ruling 11) — and `pub fn popovers_changed_later(&self)`, the same on the next idle, through the new field `me: Weak<Bar>`;
  - in `impl athanor_apps::Host for Bar` (Unit A): `menu_opened` also calls `popovers_changed_later()`, and a new `hold` override calls `popovers_changed()` on `false`. These carry the rows' menus, which `athanor-apps` attaches itself;
  - in `ui::popup`: `pub fn attach_popover(bar: &Rc<Bar>, button: &gtk4::Button, popover: &impl IsA<gtk4::Popover>)`, over `athanor_apps::menu::attach_popover`. `attach` keeps its signature. `Popup::new` and Task 7's menus go through them.

The popups are one layer surface for the whole bar, anchored to the panel edge and to the end edge, with no output named (ruling 2). It is created at the first popup and hidden, never destroyed, when none is left: cosmic-comp closes the connection of a client that destroys a layer surface of an output that left (see `Surface::abandon` in `ui/mod.rs`), and it cannot tell which output the compositor put the surface on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `src/ui/popups.rs`**

        let (end, start) = if i18n::is_rtl() {
            (Edge::Left, Edge::Right)
        } else {
            (Edge::Right, Edge::Left)
        };
        self.window.set_anchor(edge, true);
        self.window.set_anchor(far, false);
        self.window.set_anchor(end, true);
        self.window.set_anchor(start, false);
        self.window.set_margin(edge, MARGIN);
        self.window.set_margin(end, MARGIN);
        while let Some(child) = self.cards.first_child() {
            self.cards.remove(&child);
        }
        let mut ordered: Vec<&Notice> = notices.iter().collect();
        if panel == PanelEdge::Bottom {
            ordered.reverse();
        }
        for notice in ordered {
            self.cards.append(&card(service, notice, Place::Popup));
        }
        self.window.present();
    }

    pub(super) fn hide(&self) {
        self.window.set_visible(false);
    }

    pub(super) fn visible(&self) -> bool {
        self.window.is_visible()
    }

    /// Lets the window go without destroying its layer surface (see `Surface::abandon`).
    // ponytail: the output under the surface is not known, so any output that leaves while
    // the popups show costs one empty, transparent window for the life of the process; track
    // the surface's monitor (`gdk::Surface::enter-monitor`) if that ever shows up.
    pub(super) fn abandon(self) {
        self.window.set_child(None::<&gtk4::Widget>);
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Extend the service in `ui/notifications.rs`**

Add to the `use super::…` line of the file:

```rust
use super::popups::Window;
```

Add two fields at the end of `pub struct Service`:

```rust
    /// The popup surface, created at the first popup and then only hidden.
    window: RefCell<Option<Window>>,
    /// The pointer is over the popups (ruling 4).
    pointer_inside: Cell<bool>,
```

and initialize them at the end of the `Service { … }` literal in `start`:

```rust
                window: RefCell::new(None),
                pointer_inside: Cell::new(false),
```

Replace `paused`:

```rust
    /// While a popover of the bar is open the popups are hidden, and their time stands
    /// still (BR6 "Stacking", ruling 3); the pointer over them pauses it too (ruling 4).
    fn paused(&self) -> bool {
        self.pointer_inside.get() || self.bar.upgrade().is_some_and(|bar| bar.popover_is_open())
    }
```

Replace `changed`:

```rust
    fn changed(&self) {
        self.redraw_popups();
        if let Some(bar) = self.bar.upgrade() {
            bar.refresh(Changed::Notifications);
        }
    }
```

Add these methods to `impl Service`, after `changed`:

```rust
    pub(super) fn pointer(&self, inside: bool) {
        self.pointer_inside.set(inside);
    }

    /// Draws the visible popups, or hides the surface when there are none or a popover of
    /// the bar is open. GTK sends no `leave` to a window that hides, so hiding also clears
    /// the pointer (Review Focus 1).
    pub(super) fn redraw_popups(&self) {
        let (Some(bar), Some(me)) = (self.bar.upgrade(), self.me.upgrade()) else {
            return;
        };
        let shown: Vec<Notice> = {
            let held = self.held.borrow();
            self.popups
                .borrow()
                .visible()
                .into_iter()
                .filter_map(|id| held.get(id).cloned())
                .collect()
        };
        if shown.is_empty() || !self.live() || bar.popover_is_open() {
            if let Some(window) = self.window.borrow().as_ref() {
                window.hide();
            }
            self.pointer_inside.set(false);
            return;
        }
        let mut window = self.window.borrow_mut();
        let window = window.get_or_insert_with(|| Window::new(&bar, &self.me));
        window.show(&bar, &me, &shown);
    }

    /// An output left. If the popups show, their surface may be on it: it is abandoned, and
    /// the next popup gets a new one on an output still there (Review Focus 4).
    pub(super) fn output_left(&self) {
        let showing = self
            .window
            .borrow()
            .as_ref()
            .is_some_and(|window| window.visible());
        if showing {
            if let Some(window) = self.window.take() {
                window.abandon();
            }
            self.pointer_inside.set(false);
        }
    }
```

`card` connects `dismiss` and `invoke` to buttons inside the window that `redraw_popups` rebuilds: the rebuild runs from `changed`, after the click handler returned, and holds no `RefCell` borrow of the service across `card` calls into GTK that could re-enter it (`window.show` is called with the `window` borrow held, but nothing reached from `show` touches `self.window`).

- [ ] **Step 3: `Bar::popovers_changed`, the `Host` hooks and the output hook in `ui/mod.rs`**

After `mod popup;` add:

```rust
mod popups;
```

In `impl Bar`, after `open_module`:

```rust
    /// A popover of the bar opened or closed: the notification popups hide or come back
    /// (BR6, "Stacking"). The shield sheet of 2b.5 calls it too (item 13).
    pub fn popovers_changed(&self) {
        self.notifications.redraw_popups();
    }

    /// `popovers_changed` on the next idle, once GTK has settled the visibility that
    /// `popover_is_open` reads: a popover about to pop up is not visible yet in this turn.
    pub fn popovers_changed_later(&self) {
        let bar = self.me.clone();
        glib::idle_add_local_once(move || {
            if let Some(bar) = bar.upgrade() {
                bar.popovers_changed();
            }
        });
    }
```

In `pub struct Bar`, after `notifications: Rc<notifications::Service>,` (Task 5):

```rust
    /// The bar itself, for the `&self` methods that defer work to an idle.
    me: Weak<Bar>,
```

and in `start`, before `notifications: notifications::Service::start(weak),`:

```rust
        me: weak.clone(),
```

In `impl Host for Bar` (Unit A, at the end of the file), replace:

```rust
    fn menu_opened(&self, menu: &gtk4::Popover) {
        self.popover_opened(menu);
    }
```

with:

```rust
    fn menu_opened(&self, menu: &gtk4::Popover) {
        self.popover_opened(menu);
        // The row calls this before `popup()`: the menu is visible only after this turn.
        self.popovers_changed_later();
    }

    fn hold(&self, held: bool) {
        // A row's menu closed (the row calls this from an idle after `closed`) or a drag
        // ended: the popups come back unless another popover is open.
        if !held {
            self.popovers_changed();
        }
    }
```

The rows' menus are attached by `athanor_apps::menu::attach` inside `athanor-apps` and never pass through the bar's `popup.rs`: these two hooks are how they reach the popups. A drag's `hold(false)` redraws too, which changes nothing when no popover is open.

At the end of `rebuild`, after the `for changed in Changed::ALL { … }` loop:

```rust
        self.popovers_changed();
```

In `surface`, inside the `connect_invalidate` closure, replace:

```rust
            if let Some(bar) = weak.upgrade() {
                tracing::info!("an output left; the bar surfaces are rebuilt");
                bar.schedule();
            }
```

with:

```rust
            if let Some(bar) = weak.upgrade() {
                tracing::info!("an output left; the bar surfaces are rebuilt");
                bar.notifications.output_left();
                bar.schedule();
            }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: `attach_popover` in `ui/popup.rs`**

Since Unit A, `ui/popup.rs` attaches through `athanor_apps::menu`, which parents the popover, sets its position and css class, and keeps the button's `HasPopup` and `Expanded` state. The bar adds its `show` and `closed` hooks on top. Replace:

```rust
/// A popover for `button`, opening towards the inside of the screen. athanor-apps parents
/// it and keeps the button's `Expanded` state.
pub fn attach(bar: &Rc<Bar>, button: &gtk4::Button) -> gtk4::Popover {
    athanor_apps::menu::attach(button, towards_inside(bar))
}
```

with the pair below. `attach` keeps its signature for `Popup::new`.

```rust
/// A popover for `button`, attached by [`attach_popover`].
pub fn attach(bar: &Rc<Bar>, button: &gtk4::Button) -> gtk4::Popover {
    let popover = gtk4::Popover::new();
    attach_popover(bar, button, &popover);
    popover
}

/// `athanor_apps::menu::attach_popover` towards the inside of the screen, for a popover of
/// the bar (`Popup`'s, or the tray's `PopoverMenu`), which also tells the bar when it shows
/// and closes so the notification popups hide under it (BR6, "Stacking"). The rows' menus
/// reach the bar through `Host::menu_opened` and `Host::hold` instead.
pub fn attach_popover(bar: &Rc<Bar>, button: &gtk4::Button, popover: &impl IsA<gtk4::Popover>) {
    athanor_apps::menu::attach_popover(button, popover, towards_inside(bar));
    let popover = popover.upcast_ref::<gtk4::Popover>();
    let weak_bar = Rc::downgrade(bar);
    popover.connect_show(move |_| {
        if let Some(bar) = weak_bar.upgrade() {
            bar.popovers_changed_later();
        }
    });
    let weak_bar = Rc::downgrade(bar);
    popover.connect_closed(move |_| {
        if let Some(bar) = weak_bar.upgrade() {
            bar.popovers_changed_later();
        }
    });
}
```

The imports of `popup.rs` do not change: `IsA` comes with `gtk4::prelude::*`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and run the bar's gates**

```bash
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh layer-guard bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh atspi bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh bar-e2e
for scene in bar-power bar-calendar; do bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh surface "$scene"; done
```

Expected: every gate passes as before; the two popover scenes still match their goldens (the popover hooks change no pixel). The popups themselves are exercised in Task 8, against the fake service.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/popups.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/notifications.rs \
    forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/popup.rs
git commit -m "feat(bar): notification popups at the end corner, hidden under the bar's popovers"
```

### Task 7: the tray host and its menus

**Files:**
- Modify: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/tray.rs` (the scroll helper and its test)
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/tray.rs`
- Create: `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/menu.rs`
- Modify (shared): `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs`
- Modify (shared): `po/POTFILES.in`, `po/athanor-bar.pot`, `po/en.po`, `po/it.po`; `forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3 (`tray::{read, split_id, Item, Status, MAX_ITEMS}`), Task 4 (`dbusmenu::{parse_layout, event, Entry, Item, Layout, Toggle}`), Task 5 (`notifications::{texture, has_icon}`, `Bar::open_module`), Task 6 (`popup::attach_popover`).
- Produces:
  - `athanor_bar::tray::scroll_delta(delta: f64) -> Option<i32>`;
  - `Changed::Tray`; on `Bar`: the field `tray: Rc<tray::Host>`;
  - `ui::tray::Host` with `start(bar: &Weak<Bar>) -> Rc<Host>`, `ui::tray::new(bar) -> Option<Box<dyn ModuleUi>>`;
  - `ui::menu::Menu` with `new(bar: &Rc<Bar>, button: &gtk4::Button) -> Rc<Menu>`, `open(&self, connection: gio::DBusConnection, service: String, path: String)`, `popdown(&self)`.

The host follows `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` (served by `athanor-shelld`, 2b.1), registers the bar as the host by its unique name, and reads every item with one `GetAll`, again on any signal of the item's interface. A fetch in flight coalesces the signals that arrive meanwhile into one more fetch: an item that emits `NewIcon` in a loop costs one call at a time, not one per signal.

- [ ] **Step 1: The scroll helper, test first**

Append to the `tests` module of `src/tray.rs`:

```rust
    #[test]
    fn scroll_turns_gtk_steps_into_bounded_sni_deltas() {
        assert_eq!(scroll_delta(1.0), Some(-120), "down in GTK is negative in SNI");
        assert_eq!(scroll_delta(-0.5), Some(60));
        assert_eq!(scroll_delta(0.0), None);
        assert_eq!(scroll_delta(1.0e9), Some(-1200));
        assert_eq!(scroll_delta(f64::NAN), None);
    }
```

Run: `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-bar --lib tray::`
Expected: FAIL, `scroll_delta` is not defined.

Add to `src/tray.rs`, after `read`:

```rust
/// The `Scroll` delta for a GTK scroll step: 120 per notch as Qt counts, positive away
/// from the user (GTK counts down as positive), bounded to ten notches. `None` for no
/// movement (open doubt 4: the sign follows KDE's host).
#[must_use]
pub fn scroll_delta(delta: f64) -> Option<i32> {
    if !delta.is_finite() || delta.abs() < f64::EPSILON {
        return None;
    }
    // In range after the clamp, so the cast neither saturates nor truncates past a notch.
    Some((-(delta * 120.0)).clamp(-1200.0, 1200.0) as i32)
}
```

Run: `rig_cargo test --locked -p athanor-bar --lib tray::`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `src/ui/menu.rs`**

```rust
//! A tray item's menu (doc_bar.md BR5): `com.canonical.dbusmenu`, bounded by
//! `dbusmenu::parse_layout`, drawn as a `PopoverMenu` whose actions send `Event`. Labels are
//! plain text; an underscore is doubled so GTK draws it instead of taking it as a mnemonic.

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire the module into `ui/mod.rs`**

After `mod logind;` (next to `mod notifications;`):

```rust
mod menu;
```

and after `mod running;`:

```rust
mod tray;
```

`ui/mod.rs` imports the trait `athanor_apps::Host` since Unit A; the tray's `Host` stays path-qualified there (`tray::Host`), so the two never meet.

In `enum Changed`, after `Notifications,`:

```rust
    /// The tray: an item came, left, or changed.
    Tray,
```

and replace the `ALL` constant with:

```rust
    pub const ALL: [Changed; 8] = [
        Changed::Windows,
        Changed::Workspaces,
        Changed::Keyboard,
        Changed::Accessibility,
        Changed::Favorites,
        Changed::Tick,
        Changed::Notifications,
        Changed::Tray,
    ];
```

In `pub struct Bar`, after the `notifications` field:

```rust
    /// One tray host per bar: the watcher knows the bar as a single host.
    tray: Rc<tray::Host>,
```

In `start`, after `notifications: notifications::Service::start(weak),`:

```rust
        tray: tray::Host::start(weak),
```

In `fn build`, after `Module::Notifications => notifications::new(bar),`:

```rust
        Module::Tray => tray::new(bar),
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The string**

`src/ui/tray.rs` goes after `src/ui/tiling.rs`, before the two `athanor-apps` sources; the file is not re-sorted (Task 5 Step 5).

```bash
f=forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/POTFILES.in
sed -i '\|^src/ui/tiling\.rs$|a src/ui/tray.rs' "$f"
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo localhost/athanor-shell-rig:build \
    bash -c 'forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/update.sh \
             && msgen --no-wrap -o forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/en.po \
                forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/en.po'
python3 - forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/it.po <<'EOF'
import re
import sys

path = sys.argv[1]
text = open(path, encoding="utf-8").read()
entry = re.compile(r'((?:#[^\n]*\n)*)msgid "System tray"\nmsgstr ""\n')
match = entry.search(text)
if not match:
    sys.exit('"System tray" is not an empty entry of the catalog')
comments = "".join(
    line + "\n"
    for line in match.group(1).splitlines()
    if not line.startswith("#|") and line != "#, fuzzy"
)
text = text[: match.start()] + comments + 'msgid "System tray"\nmsgstr "Vassoio di sistema"\n' + text[match.end() :]
open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8").write(text)
EOF
cat >> forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po <<'EOF'

msgid "System tray"
msgstr "Infobereich"
EOF
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" -w /repo localhost/athanor-shell-rig:build \
    bash -c 'for po in forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/*.po forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po; do msgfmt --check --statistics -o /dev/null "$po"; done'
```

Expected: every catalog passes, with one more translated message than after Task 5 and no fuzzy or untranslated one.

- [ ] **Step 6: Build and run the bar's gates**

```bash
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh atspi bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh bar-e2e
```

Expected: every gate passes as before. The rig's bar scenes have no watcher on the bus, so the tray row stays hidden and `atspi bar` still counts 7 interactive widgets. The tray against a real watcher is Task 8.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/tray.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/tray.rs \
    forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/menu.rs forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/src/ui/mod.rs \
    forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po
git commit -m "feat(bar): tray host with dbusmenu menus"
```

---
### Task 8: the rig, the scenes and CI

**Files:**
- Create: `forge/test/shell/fake_notifications.py`
- Create: `forge/test/shell/tray_item.py`
- Create: `forge/test/shell/notifications_e2e.py`
- Create: `forge/test/shell/tray_e2e.py`
- Modify (shared): `forge/test/shell/bar_session.py` (rewritten whole: four new flags)
- Modify (shared): `forge/test/shell/rig.sh` (help, `capture_bar`, two e2e blocks, the surface dispatch)
- Modify (shared): `forge/test/shell/atspi_check.py` (two roles)
- Modify (shared): `forge/test/shell/cases.py`, `forge/test/shell/tests/test_cases.py`
- Create: `forge/test/shell/golden/bar-popups/*.png`, `golden/bar-notifications/*.png`, `golden/bar-tray/*.png` (12 each, by `update-goldens`)
- Modify (shared): `.github/workflows/shell-surfaces.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the binaries of Tasks 5–7; `athanor-shelld` (2b.1) as the tray watcher.
- Produces: `bar_session.py [--client NAME] [--hang METHOD] [--window] [--pinnable] [--notifications] [--tray] [--respawn]`; `rig.sh notifications-e2e`, `rig.sh tray-e2e`; the scenes `bar-popups`, `bar-notifications`, `bar-tray`. The logs `/out/$RIG_TAG-notifications.log` and `/out/$RIG_TAG-tray.log` are what the e2e scripts read.

Ruling 10 applies: the notification scenes run a fake of the private interface, the tray scenes the real `athanor-shelld`, which refuses the bar's `List` in a container without systemd, so every tray run also proves the Refused path.

- [ ] **Step 1: The fake notification daemon, `forge/test/shell/fake_notifications.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""fake_notifications.py - athanor-shelld's notification side, faked for the rig
(doc_bar.md BR1, BR4). The real daemon admits the private interface only from a process in
athanor-bar.service, which a container without systemd cannot provide (plan ruling 10).

It owns org.freedesktop.Notifications with Notify and CloseNotification, so a test sends a
notification the way an application does, and serves os.athanor.Notifications1 with the
wire signature the bar decodes. Its signals are broadcast, not unicast as the real
daemon's: the bar subscribes by sender, so it cannot tell.

It starts holding four notifications, all waiting for the user, so the captures show three
popups and "+1 waiting". Every call that acts is appended to /out/$RIG_TAG-notifications.log:
"Close <id> <reason>", "InvokeAction <id> <key> token|no-token", "SetDoNotDisturb True|False".

- [ ] **Step 3: `bar_session.py`, rewritten with four new flags** (Unit A leaves this file as it is at 6e1d357f. The whole-file rewrite keeps `--window`, `--pinnable` and `DESKTOP_ENTRY`; the dock's rig session reuses this file through `--client athanor-dock`)

The window now starts once only: a respawned bar sends READY=1 again, and a second test window would change the scene. The helpers start before the bar, so its first question finds them. A bar or an `athanor-shelld` killed with SIGKILL is started again, as `Restart=on-failure` does; any other exit of either ends the session with a failure. `athanor-shelld` runs without the frozen clock: `LD_PRELOAD` and `FAKETIME*` are dropped from its environment, so it runs exactly as `shelld-e2e` runs it.

Replace the whole of `forge/test/shell/bar_session.py` with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""bar_session.py [--client NAME] [--hang METHOD] [--window] [--pinnable] [--notifications]
[--tray] [--respawn] - athanor-bar in the rig, as its unit runs it: a private system bus with a fake
logind on it, NOTIFY_SOCKET for Type=notify, and with --window one test window for the
running applications. --pinnable installs a desktop entry for the test window's app id, so
the bar offers to pin it. It is scene.sh's client and exits with the bar's status.

The fake logind answers CanSuspend "yes", CanReboot "yes" and CanPowerOff "challenge",
except the method named by --hang, which it never answers. Every call that acts is appended
to /out/$RIG_TAG-logind.log as "<Method> <arguments>", e.g. "Suspend True". The log is
created empty before the bar starts: a missing log means the fake logind never ran.

--client names the binary under /out/bin that runs as the client, athanor-bar by default;
the dock's rig session runs athanor-dock through it, with every other flag unchanged.

--notifications starts fake_notifications.py (athanor-shelld's private interface, faked:
the real daemon admits only athanor-bar.service). --tray starts the real athanor-shelld as
the tray watcher, with its log in /out/$RIG_TAG-shelld.log and its pid in
/tmp/athanor-shelld.pid, then tray_item.py, and starts the bar once both items are
registered. --respawn starts the bar again when it is killed with SIGKILL, and rewrites
/tmp/athanor-bar.pid; athanor-shelld is always started again after a SIGKILL.

It is a small Gio service, not python3-dbusmock: dbusmock replies to each call from the
method's code, and the power menu must also meet a logind that never replies.

```

The `press(...buttons_matching(...)[0].get_name())` lines would index an empty list if the button vanished; that is a test process, not the bar, and an `IndexError` there fails the scene loudly. The first opener is guarded explicitly because a missing notification button is the most likely failure and deserves its own line.

Run: `python3 -m py_compile forge/test/shell/notifications_e2e.py`
Expected: exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: The tray end to end, `forge/test/shell/tray_e2e.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""tray_e2e.py - package 2b.3's tray in a scene (doc_bar.md BR5, BR9, items 9, 11, 17): the bar
as the host of the real athanor-shelld's watcher, with tray_item.py's two items, and the
menu of the first open from the start (ATHANOR_BAR_OPEN=tray). Also checks the refusal path
of notifications: athanor-shelld refuses the bar's List outside athanor-bar.service, so the
notification button stays hidden (SH1). Runs as scene.sh's RIG_HOLD, with bar_session.py
--tray --respawn as the client. Prints one line per check and exits 1 if any fails.

This scene does not check "no error in the log" (a line starting `<3>`): the refusal is logged at error level on purpose (Task 5), and this is the one scene where it must appear.

Run: `python3 -m py_compile forge/test/shell/tray_e2e.py`
Expected: exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 6: Menu rows are interactive for `atspi_check.py`**

In `forge/test/shell/atspi_check.py`, the check-menu and radio-menu rows of a tray menu must carry a name like any other control. Replace the `INTERACTIVE` set with:

```python
INTERACTIVE = {"button", "push button", "toggle button", "check box", "radio button", "password text", "entry",
               "text", "combo box", "slider", "spin button", "link", "menu item", "check menu item",
               "radio menu item", "switch"}
```

Run: `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s forge/test/shell/tests`
Expected: OK (the existing `test_atspi_check.py` still passes).

- [ ] **Step 7: The three scenes in `cases.py` and its test**

In `forge/test/shell/cases.py`, replace the comment and the tuple of bar scenes:

```python
    # doc_bar.md, BR9: the bar, and the popovers of power, input source, calendar,
    # accessibility and tiling; the notification popups, the notification list and a
    # tray menu (2b.3). The other six scenes come with 2b.4 and 2b.5.
    **{
        surface: {"variants": ("light", "dark"), "scales": ("1.0", "1.5")}
        for surface in (
            "bar",
            "bar-power",
            "bar-input",
            "bar-calendar",
            "bar-accessibility",
            "bar-tiling",
            "bar-popups",
            "bar-notifications",
            "bar-tray",
        )
    },
```

In `forge/test/shell/tests/test_cases.py`, replace `BAR_SCENES` and the count test:

```python
    BAR_SCENES = (
        "bar",
        "bar-power",
        "bar-input",
        "bar-calendar",
        "bar-accessibility",
        "bar-tiling",
        "bar-popups",
        "bar-notifications",
        "bar-tray",
    )

    def test_the_bar_brings_nine_scenes_of_twelve_cases(self):
        found = [
            case for surface in self.BAR_SCENES for case in cases.surface_cases(surface)
        ]
        self.assertEqual(len(found), 108)
        self.assertEqual(len({c.tag for c in found}), 108)
```

Run: `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s forge/test/shell/tests`
Expected: OK, `test_the_bar_brings_nine_scenes_of_twelve_cases` among the tests run.

- [ ] **Step 8: `rig.sh`: the scenes and the two end-to-end commands**

`athanor-shelld` is built by the existing `rig.sh build-shelld`; `build-bar` does not change. A tray scene without the binary stops with a message instead of a timeout.

1. In the help block, after the `bar-e2e` line, add:

```bash
#   rig.sh notifications-e2e  athanor-bar against a fake of athanor-shelld's private interface: popups, list, actions, do not disturb, hostile input, restart, memory
#   rig.sh tray-e2e         athanor-bar as the tray host of athanor-shelld (run build-shelld first): items, dbusmenu menu, activation, the refused List, the watcher's restart, memory
```

and in the `surface` line, replace `bar-accessibility|bar-tiling>` with `bar-accessibility|bar-tiling|bar-popups|bar-notifications|bar-tray>`.

2. Before `capture_bar() {`, add:

```bash
require_shelld() { # the tray scenes run the real watcher
    if [ ! -x "$out/bin/athanor-shelld" ]; then
        echo "rig.sh: $out/bin/athanor-shelld is missing; run rig.sh build-shelld first" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
}

```

3. In `capture_bar`, replace the comment above it with:

```bash
# doc_bar.md, BR9: the bar under its own preset with one running window, the five
# popovers the bar owns in 2b.2, opened by ATHANOR_BAR_OPEN over the float preset, and
# 2b.3's notification popups (four waiting notifications: three show), the notification
# list and a tray menu.
```

and add three arms after `bar-tiling) open=tiling ;;`:

```bash
    bar-popups) session+=(--notifications) ;;
    bar-notifications) open=notifications session+=(--notifications) ;;
    bar-tray)
        require_shelld
        open=tray session+=(--tray)
        ;;
```

4. After the `bar-e2e` block (before `compositor-e2e)`), add:

```bash
notifications-e2e)
    seed_bar "$out/seed-notifications-e2e" float top visible light
    rm -f "$out/notifications-e2e-notifications.log"
    in_rig "$(rig_image)" env GTK_A11Y=atspi RIG_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8 RIG_SETTLE=8 \
        RIG_CONFIG_SEED=/out/seed-notifications-e2e \
        RIG_DATA_OVERLAY=/repo/system/athanor-style/calmo/generated/cosmic \
        RIG_HOLD="python3 /repo/forge/test/shell/notifications_e2e.py" \
        dbus-run-session -- /repo/forge/test/shell/scene.sh 1280 800 1.0 notifications-e2e -- \
        bash -c "busctl --user set-property org.a11y.Bus /org/a11y/bus org.a11y.Status IsEnabled b true \
                 && exec python3 /repo/forge/test/shell/bar_session.py --notifications --respawn"
    ;;
tray-e2e)
    require_shelld
    seed_bar "$out/seed-tray-e2e" float top visible light
    rm -f "$out/tray-e2e-tray.log" "$out/tray-e2e-shelld.log"
    in_rig "$(rig_image)" env GTK_A11Y=atspi RIG_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8 RIG_SETTLE=8 \
        RIG_CONFIG_SEED=/out/seed-tray-e2e ATHANOR_BAR_OPEN=tray \
        RIG_DATA_OVERLAY=/repo/system/athanor-style/calmo/generated/cosmic \
        RIG_HOLD="python3 /repo/forge/test/shell/tray_e2e.py" \
        dbus-run-session -- /repo/forge/test/shell/scene.sh 1280 800 1.0 tray-e2e -- \
        bash -c "busctl --user set-property org.a11y.Bus /org/a11y/bus org.a11y.Status IsEnabled b true \
                 && exec python3 /repo/forge/test/shell/bar_session.py --tray --respawn"
    ;;
```

5. In the surface dispatch, replace the bar arm with:

```bash
    bar | bar-power | bar-input | bar-calendar | bar-accessibility | bar-tiling | bar-popups | bar-notifications | bar-tray) capture_bar "$surface" ;;
```

Run: `shellcheck -x forge/test/shell/rig.sh && bash -n forge/test/shell/rig.sh`
Expected: no findings, exit 0.

Run: `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh notifications-e2e`
Expected: the last line is `notifications-e2e: every check passed`.

Run: `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld && bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh tray-e2e`
Expected: the last line is `tray-e2e: every check passed`.

If a check fails, the log files named in each script's docstring (`/out/<tag>-client.log`, `-notifications.log`, `-tray.log`, `-shelld.log`) are under `.scratch/shell-rig/`, and `tray-e2e` prints the accessibility tree on failure.

- [ ] **Step 9: Goldens of the three scenes**

Run:

```bash
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh update-goldens bar-popups
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh update-goldens bar-notifications
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh update-goldens bar-tray
```

Expected: 12 `golden replaced:` lines each. Look at every one of the 36 images before committing: `bar-popups` shows three cards at the end corner below the top panel (on the left in the `rtl` cases), the critical "Update ready" with the blue 16 x 16 picture, and the notification button reading "+1"; `bar-notifications` shows the list grouped by application with no popups on screen; `bar-tray` shows the green item and its open menu with the check, the two radio rows, the greyed "Sync now" and the "More" submenu row, and no notification button.

Run:

```bash
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh surface bar-popups
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh surface bar-notifications
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh surface bar-tray
```

Expected: every case matches its golden (a second capture equals the first: the scenes are deterministic).

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit the rig**

```bash
git add forge/test/shell/bar_session.py forge/test/shell/fake_notifications.py \
    forge/test/shell/tray_item.py forge/test/shell/notifications_e2e.py \
    forge/test/shell/tray_e2e.py forge/test/shell/rig.sh forge/test/shell/atspi_check.py \
    forge/test/shell/cases.py forge/test/shell/tests/test_cases.py \
    forge/test/shell/golden/bar-popups forge/test/shell/golden/bar-notifications \
    forge/test/shell/golden/bar-tray
git commit -m "test(shell): notification and tray scenes, a fake notification daemon and a tray item"
```

- [ ] **Step 11: CI runs the scenes**

In `.github/workflows/shell-surfaces.yml`, job `bar`, after the `bar-e2e` step add:

```yaml
      - name: athanor-shelld, the tray watcher of the tray scene
        run: bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld
      - name: Notification popups and list against a fake daemon
        run: bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh notifications-e2e
      - name: Tray host and menus against athanor-shelld
        run: bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh tray-e2e
```

and extend its upload `path:` with:

```yaml
            .scratch/shell-rig/notifications-e2e.png
            .scratch/shell-rig/tray-e2e.png
```

In job `bar-scenes`, add `bar-popups, bar-notifications, bar-tray,` after `bar-tiling,` in the matrix, and after the `Build the bar` step add:

```yaml
      - name: athanor-shelld, the tray watcher of the tray scene
        if: matrix.scene == 'bar-tray'
        run: bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld
```

Run: `python3 scripts/verify.py workflows`
Expected: PASS (actionlint and shellcheck on the `run:` blocks).

```bash
git add .github/workflows/shell-surfaces.yml
git commit -m "ci(shell): run the notification and tray scenes and their end-to-end checks"
```

### Task 9: Dev-VM acceptance, the admitted list and the restart

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh`
- Modify: `scripts/devvm/README.md` (one bullet)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the binaries of `rig.sh build-bar` and `rig.sh build-shelld` in `.scratch/shell-rig/bin`; the units `forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/data/athanor-bar.service` and `forge/specs/athanor-shelld/athanor-shelld-1.0.0/data/athanor-shelld.service`; `devvm.env` (`guest_ssh`, `die`), `deploy.sh`, `screenshot.sh`.
- Produces: `notifications-acceptance.sh [stage...]` with the stages `deploy admitted away hotplug memory cleanup`.

This is item 9 against the real daemon (ruling 12): the real `athanor-shelld` admits the real `athanor-bar.service`, and after the bar is killed it fetches the list again. COSMIC owns `org.freedesktop.Notifications` and `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` on the VM's session bus, so both units run on a private bus, reached through one drop-in each, as `shelld-acceptance.sh` does for the daemon alone. On that bus the bar has no accessibility bus, so the checks read the bar's journal and the unit's state, and the screenshots are for the eye.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh`**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# notifications-acceptance.sh [stage...]
# Package 2b.3 of docs/architecture/doc_bar.md in the dev VM's real session, under both real
# unit files and the real user manager: athanor-shelld admits athanor-bar.service's List,
# the bar fetches the list again after a crash and shows what arrived meanwhile (item 9),
# popups survive an output that comes and goes (BR6), and the bar stays within 64 MB holding
# notifications (item 17). COSMIC owns the notification and tray names on the session bus,
# so both units run on a private bus at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/athanor-notifications-acceptance-bus
# (the same socket-activated dbus-broker pair as shelld-acceptance.sh), through a drop-in
# each. On that bus the bar has no accessibility bus: the stages read its journal and the
# units' state; the screenshots in .scratch/notifications-acceptance/ are for the eye.
# Deploys both binaries from .scratch/shell-rig/bin (forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar and
# build-shelld) and both units. With no argument it runs every stage in order; with
# arguments, only those, in the order given. Prints PASS <stage> or FAIL <stage>: <what was
# read>, and exits non-zero on the first failure. Cleanup always runs on exit, through a trap.

The `-1` in `notify "Memory probe $n" -1` is the expire timeout "server default" (5 s): the popups end on their own, so the stage measures a bar holding twenty notifications in its list, the steady state of item 17. The `--` in `notify` ends gdbus's own options, so GOption does not read that `-1` as one: without it `gdbus call` prints its usage and exits non-zero.

Run: `chmod +x scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh && shellcheck -x scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh`
Expected: no findings.

- [ ] **Step 2: The README bullet**

In `scripts/devvm/README.md`, after the `bar-acceptance.sh` bullet, add (with Bash, not Edit: the formatter rewrites Markdown files whole):

```markdown
- `notifications-acceptance.sh [stage...]`: athanor-bar and athanor-shelld under their real
  units on a private bus (package 2b.3): the daemon admits the bar's List, a notification
  sent while the bar is down shows after its restart (item 9), popups across an output that
  comes and goes (needs `GPU_OUTPUTS=2`), and PSS within 64 MB with notifications held.
  Build both binaries first with `forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar` and `build-shelld`.
  Screenshots land in `.scratch/notifications-acceptance/`; look at them.
```

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
path = Path("scripts/devvm/README.md")
text = path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
anchor = "  vendor layout. Build the binary first with `forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar`.\n"
bullet = (
    "- `notifications-acceptance.sh [stage...]`: athanor-bar and athanor-shelld under their real\n"
    "  units on a private bus (package 2b.3): the daemon admits the bar's List, a notification\n"
    "  sent while the bar is down shows after its restart (item 9), popups across an output that\n"
    "  comes and goes (needs `GPU_OUTPUTS=2`), and PSS within 64 MB with notifications held.\n"
    "  Build both binaries first with `forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar` and `build-shelld`.\n"
    "  Screenshots land in `.scratch/notifications-acceptance/`; look at them.\n"
)
assert text.count(anchor) == 1
path.write_text(text.replace(anchor, anchor + bullet), encoding="utf-8")
PY
git diff --stat scripts/devvm/README.md
```

Expected: `1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)` and no deletions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it in the dev VM**

Run: `bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar && bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld && scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh`
Expected: `PASS deploy`, `PASS admitted`, `PASS away`, `PASS hotplug`, `PASS memory`, `PASS cleanup`. Look at `admitted.png` (one popup at the end corner), `away.png` (the popup "Sent while the bar was away") and `hotplug.png`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh scripts/devvm/README.md
git commit -m "test(devvm): notifications acceptance, admitted list and respawn"
```

## Acceptance

Every command runs from the worktree root, with no `cd`. All must pass before the package is handed to the whole-package review.

```bash
# The rig and the binaries.
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-image
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-bar          # clippy -D warnings, unit tests, release build, DT_NEEDED order
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-compositor-client   # the crate whose activation_token became pub

# The surface and its accessibility.
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh layer-guard bar
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh atspi bar          # still 7: no notification daemon and no watcher in that scene

# End to end.
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh bar-e2e
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh notifications-e2e
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh tray-e2e

# The nine bar scenes against their goldens (108 cases).
for scene in bar bar-power bar-input bar-calendar bar-accessibility bar-tiling \
    bar-popups bar-notifications bar-tray; do
    bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh surface "$scene"
done

# The rig's own tests, the style and the catalogues.
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s forge/test/shell/tests
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s system/athanor-style/calmo/tests
python3 -B system/athanor-style/calmo/generate.py css --check
bash forge/test/shell/rig.sh css-parse
msgfmt --check -o /dev/null forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/en.po
msgfmt --check -o /dev/null forge/specs/athanor-bar/athanor-bar-1.0.0/po/it.po
msgfmt --check -o /dev/null forge/test/shell/locale/bar-de.po

# The project's verifier and the scripts.
python3 scripts/verify.py
shellcheck -x forge/test/shell/rig.sh scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh

# The dev VM (item 9 against the real daemon, BR6 across outputs, item 17 with notifications held).
scripts/devvm/notifications-acceptance.sh
```

Expected: every command exits 0; the e2e commands end with `every check passed`; every scene reports each of its 12 cases equal to its golden; the dev-VM run prints six `PASS` lines.

## Self-review

**Spec coverage** (`doc_bar.md` rev 1, `doc_shell.md` rev 5):

| Requirement | Where |
| --- | --- |
| BR1: the bar is the only client of the private interface; a refused `List` hides the module | Task 5 (`State::Refused`), Task 8 (`tray_e2e.py` sees the refusal), Task 9 (`admitted`) |
| BR3/SH1: a module with no source is not shown | Task 5 (button hidden unless `Live`), Task 7 (tray hidden with no watcher or no non-Passive item) |
| BR4: 3 popups, "+N waiting", critical waits, DND, transient, actions with an activation token, default action, grouping, clear all, list of 100 | Tasks 1, 2, 5, 6; `notifications_e2e.py` |
| BR5: tray host, Activate/SecondaryActivate/ContextMenu/Scroll, ItemIsMenu, dbusmenu with check, radio, disabled, submenus, invisible entries, AboutToShow, Event | Tasks 3, 4, 7; `tray_e2e.py` |
| BR6 Stacking: popups hidden under any bar popover, one popover at a time | Task 6 (`redraw_popups`; the `attach_popover` hooks for the bar's popovers, `Host::menu_opened` and `Host::hold` for the rows' menus), Task 7 (menus are bar popovers); `notifications_e2e.py` |
| BR9: unit tests for every parser of untrusted input; scenes; accessible names | Tasks 1, 3, 4 (tests); Task 8 (three scenes, `problems()` checks) |
| Item 9: bar killed, then back; shelld killed, icons back | Task 8 (both e2e scripts; `notifications_e2e.py` also restarts the bar under do not disturb and requires the listed transient notification closed as Expired), Task 9 (`away`, against an emptied daemon) |
| Item 10: markup, bidi overrides, control characters as text; oversized `image-data` refused | Task 1 (tests), Task 8 (`notifications_e2e.py` hostile block) |
| Item 11: callers outside the unit refused | 2b.1, seen again from the bar in `tray_e2e.py` (ruling 12) |
| Item 13: hook only | Task 6 (`Bar::popovers_changed`, ruling 11) |
| Item 17: 64 MB PSS | both e2e scripts, Task 9 (`memory`) |
| Item 18 / SH13: 12 cases per scene, a popover scene starts open | Task 8 (`bar-popups`, `bar-notifications`, `bar-tray`: 36 of the 180) |

**Placeholder scan.** No "TBD", "TODO" or "similar to Task N"; every code step carries its code. Every `ponytail:` note names its ceiling and its upgrade path.

**Type consistency.** Checked across tasks: `Service::output_left()` takes no argument (Task 6, called from `ui/mod.rs`); `notifications::has_icon` is `pub(super)` and used by `ui/tray.rs` (Tasks 5, 7); `popup::attach_popover(bar, button, &impl IsA<gtk4::Popover>)` is used by `ui/menu.rs` (Tasks 6, 7); it and `Host::menu_opened` call `Bar::popovers_changed_later`, and `Host::hold(false)` calls `Bar::popovers_changed`, against `athanor_apps::Host` and `athanor_apps::menu::attach_popover` at b648f633 (Task 6); `tray::scroll_delta(f64) -> Option<i32>` (Task 7); the wire signature `(usssa(ss)ybbsssuuayuu)` is the same string in `notices.rs`, `fake_notifications.py` and athanor-shelld's `wire.rs`; the log lines the e2e scripts read (`Close <id> <reason>`, `InvokeAction <id> <key> token` (the fake writes `no-token` for an empty one, which the rig refuses), `SetDoNotDisturb True|False`, `Activate 0 0`, `AboutToShow 0`, `GetLayout 0 -1`, `Event <id> <name>`) are the ones the fakes write; the bar's journal lines `listed N notifications from athanor-shelld` and `refused the bar's List` (Task 5) are the ones Tasks 8 and 9 grep.

**Review Focus.** Each of the five has its pin in the owning task; the pointer half of item 1 has no automated test (no pointer in the headless rig) and is named as such.

**Open doubts for the executor**, each with where it would show:

1. Whether GTK 4.20 exports a working AT-SPI action on `PopoverMenu` rows (`tray_e2e.py` "Open window"). If not, the step fails loudly; the fix is in the test (activate through the row's parent), not in the bar.
2. Whether GTK exports `AccessibleRole::Alert` as `notification` or `alert`; `ALERT_ROLES` accepts both.
3. Whether cosmic-comp places a layer surface with no output on the active output (ruling 2). `bar-popups` would show it on the only output in the rig either way; the dev VM's `hotplug` screenshot is where a wrong choice shows.
4. The `Scroll` sign convention: `scroll_delta` sends -120 for a wheel step down, as KDE's host does; some items may read it the other way.
5. Whether cosmic-comp honours, for `InvokeAction`, a token whose serial belongs to a layer surface with `KeyboardMode::None` (GDK's launch context uses the serial of the last implicit grab and its surface, here the popup's button press). The rig requires `token`: an empty one means the token path broke, and is a finding to report, not a check to loosen. Whether the application then raises its window is for the dev VM's eye.
6. `output_left()` abandons the popup window on any output removal while popups show, not only when the removed output held them: correct, at the cost of one leaked empty surface per such removal until the bar restarts.
