# System image: base and GPU variants

Status: **approved by the maintainer on 2026-09-16; implemented by docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-16-system-image-variants.md**. This document records what the maintainer decided on 2026-09-16: option C+A, with Fedora's atomic desktop base. `doc_kernel_build.md` (section 10) and `doc_kernel_profile.md` (sections 6 and 14) keep owning the kernel modules and the kernel profile; section 8 lists what they must change to agree with this document.

## 1. Context

On 2026-09-16 the maintainer's desktop switched to `athanor-system:latest`, which carries Azoth 7.2.5. The signed open NVIDIA modules 610.57.04 loaded, which proves that the module signing key from the rotation is trusted. The GPUs, however, never initialised:

- **What the image ships:** only the `.ko` files (`system/Containerfile` copies `azoth-nvidia:<nvr>-open`).
- **What is missing:**
  - the GSP firmware the open modules require (`/usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/<version>/gsp_ga10x.bin`, `gsp_tu10x.bin`);
  - the NVIDIA userspace: `libEGL_nvidia`, the GBM backend `nvidia-drm_gbm.so`, the Vulkan ICD and `nvidia-smi`.
- **Visible result:** `/dev/dri` held only `simple-framebuffer` (one output at 800×600), with no `/dev/nvidia*` nodes. `cosmic-panel` failed `eglInitialize`, and the session ran without acceleration on one monitor.
- **Why it was hidden until now:** the kernel rejected `nvidia` because of the key, and `nouveau` drove both GPUs.
- **Why acceptance did not catch it:** the ISO acceptance VM has no GPU.

The base `ghcr.io/hr-mes/ermete-base-nvidia:latest` was built on 2026-07-05 (`org.opencontainers.image.version=latest.20260705`) from `patapem/ermete-base-nvidia`, a repository that no longer resolves.

- **Contents:** 1392 packages. Its `/usr/share/rpm-ostree/treefile.json` is the treefile of Fedora's atomic desktop base.
- **Additions on top of that base:**
  - the negativo17 repository (`fedora-nvidia`), enabled;
  - RPM Fusion free and nonfree, enabled;
  - Cisco openh264;
  - `kargs.d/01-nvidia.toml`;
  - NVIDIA sleep presets;
  - `nvidia-kmod-common`;
  - a `kmod-nvidia` for kernel 6.18.38.
- **What it never carried:** any NVIDIA userspace.

## 2. Decisions

**S1. Base image.** The image starts from `quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/base-atomic:43`, pinned by digest.

- **Who publishes it:** the Fedora Atomic Desktops SIG, as the common base of Silverblue and Kinoite. It is rebuilt daily (`43.20260916.0` at the time of writing).
- **What it is:** a bootc image (`containers.bootc=1`, `ostree.bootable=true`). It shares the bottom layer of `fedora-bootc:43` (same `ostree.final-diffid`) and adds the desktop plumbing: NetworkManager with Wi-Fi and WWAN, pipewire, bluez, firmware, CUPS, ibus, Mesa, flatpak and Xwayland.
- **What it replaces:** `ermete-base-nvidia`. The additions that base made become declared, reviewed content of this repository:
  - repositories, as pinned release packages with vendored GPG keys;
  - codecs: Cisco openh264 from Fedora's `fedora-cisco-openh264` repository replaces the `noopenh264` stub of the base;
  - presets.

  Nothing is inherited from an image that no one rebuilds.

The bump bot moves the digest by pull request, as it does for the kernel Containerfiles.

**S2. Three images from one Containerfile.** They are identical except for a final GPU layer:

| Image | GPU layer | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `athanor-system` | none: `nouveau` with Mesa NVK (Vulkan) and Zink (OpenGL) | every machine, and the default install |
| `athanor-system-nvidia` | signed open modules + NVIDIA userspace at `NVIDIA_OPEN_VERSION` | NVIDIA Turing and later |
| `athanor-system-nvidia-legacy` | signed legacy modules + NVIDIA userspace at `NVIDIA_LEGACY_VERSION` | NVIDIA Maxwell, Pascal, Volta |

The tier packages, the upstream packages, the UKI assembly and the hardening are shared stages, so a variant cannot drift from the default image except in its GPU layer.

**S3. The default image carries no NVIDIA blobs.** In `athanor-system`:

- no `nvidia*.ko`;
- no `nvidia-*` kernel arguments, modprobe options or dracut configuration;
- no negativo17 or RPM Fusion NVIDIA repository.

`nouveau` loads from the root filesystem with the firmware of `nvidia-gpu-firmware`, which the base already ships. This is the default tier that `doc_kernel_build.md` section 10 already specifies.

**S4. `athanor-system-nvidia`.** The GPU layer adds:

- **The signed open modules** from `azoth-nvidia:<kernel-nvr>-open`, as today.
- **negativo17 packages at exactly `3:NVIDIA_OPEN_VERSION`:**
  - `nvidia-kmod-common`: GSP firmware, udev rules, `modprobe.d` including the `nouveau` blacklist, dracut configuration;
  - `nvidia-driver` and `nvidia-driver-libs`: EGL, GLX, GBM backend, Vulkan ICD;
  - `nvidia-driver-cuda` and `nvidia-persistenced`: `nvidia-smi`, CUDA libraries.
- **`azoth-nvidia-kmod`,** a package built in this repository that provides `nvidia-kmod = 3:<version>`. `nvidia-kmod-common` requires that capability. The package contains no module: the modules come from the signed image above, and akmods and DKMS are never installed.
- **`athanor-nvidia-config`,** which moves out of `athanor-base-config`: `kargs.d/01-nvidia.toml`, `nvidia-drm` options and the persistence daemon preset. It is the same package in both variants:
  - it blacklists `nouveau` and `nova_core` in `modprobe.d` and on the kernel command line (`rd.driver.blacklist=` and `modprobe.blacklist=`), because RPM Fusion sets these arguments only through `grubby`, which does nothing in an image build;
  - power management and the initrd policy (NVIDIA modules omitted from the initrd) stay with the vendor packages of each branch: negativo17 uses the kernel suspend notifiers (`NVreg_UseKernelSuspendNotifiers=1`), and RPM Fusion's `xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power` ships and presets the suspend, resume and hibernate units.

**S5. `athanor-system-nvidia-legacy`.** The same structure, with three differences:

- the signed legacy modules come from `azoth-nvidia:<kernel-nvr>-legacy`;
- the userspace is RPM Fusion's `xorg-x11-drv-nvidia` family at exactly `NVIDIA_LEGACY_VERSION`, including `xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power` for suspend and resume, because negativo17 publishes no 580 for Fedora 43;
- no GSP firmware is needed.

The shim provides whatever kernel-module capability those packages require; the implementation plan reads it from their `Requires` before building the shim.

**S6. Version lock, enforced at build time.** The image build fails unless all of these carry the same version:

- the `version` field of every `nvidia*.ko` in the image;
- the installed driver packages;
- for the open branch, the firmware directory `/usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/<version>`;
- the pin in `forge/specs/azoth/pins.env`.

A mismatch is a build failure with the exact values, never a warning.

**S7. Provenance of third-party RPMs.** Driver packages are installed by exact NVR from the pinned repository URL:

- **Hashes:** the SHA-256 of each RPM is recorded in a manifest, `system/nvidia/locks/<branch>.lock`, one per driver branch (`open`, `legacy`), and the build verifies it before installation. A branch can also lock companion packages whose version does not follow the driver's, such as negativo17's `nvidia-driver-selinux` that `nvidia-kmod-common` requires whenever `selinux-policy-targeted` is installed: they are locked at the newest release the repository publishes, under the same hash and repository rules.
- **Signatures:** `gpgcheck` stays on, with the negativo17 and RPM Fusion keys vendored in the repository. Package signatures are checked. negativo17 does not sign its repository metadata, which the manifest compensates for.
- **Bumps:**
  - the bump bot regenerates the manifests whenever an `NVIDIA_*` pin moves;
  - `NVIDIA_OPEN_VERSION` moves only to a version that both `NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules` and negativo17 publish;
  - `NVIDIA_LEGACY_VERSION` moves only to a version RPM Fusion publishes.

**S8. Build, publication and installation.**

- **Build and publication:**
  - `call-system-image.yml` builds the default image, then the two variants from the shared stages;
  - each image is pushed, signed and SBOM-attested like `athanor-system` today;
  - the signing job serves all three images, so a cycle needs one approval of the `signing` environment. The plan verifies that GitHub groups the waiting jobs into one review.
- **Installation:**
  - the installer ISO stays single and installs `athanor-system`;
  - a machine with NVIDIA hardware moves to its variant with `bootc switch ghcr.io/hr-mes/athanor-system-nvidia:latest`, or `-nvidia-legacy`;
  - detecting the GPU in the installer and choosing the image there is future work.
- **Acceptance:**
  - ISO acceptance keeps installing the default image in a VM without GPU;
  - the variants are gated by S6 and by build-time checks that the GSP firmware, `10_nvidia.json`, `nvidia-drm_gbm.so` and the Vulkan ICD are present;
  - a release of `athanor-system-nvidia` also requires the hardware check of section 6.

## 3. What this replaces

- **The base image:** `ghcr.io/hr-mes/ermete-base-nvidia:latest` and its implicit repositories.
- **In `athanor-base-config`:** the NVIDIA kernel arguments and `nvidia-drm.conf`, which move to `athanor-nvidia-config` and are installed only by the variants, and the NVIDIA sleep scripts, which the vendor packages of each branch replace (S4).
- **In `system/Containerfile`:** the unconditional copy of the open modules into every image.

## 4. Risks

- **negativo17 has a single maintainer and keeps only a few versions.**
  - The manifest makes a disappearance visible as a failing build.
  - The fallback is to extract firmware and userspace from NVIDIA's `.run` of the pinned version ourselves. `nvidia.sh` already downloads it for the legacy branch.
- **RPM Fusion keeps only the latest release.**
  - `updates/43` publishes only the newest NVR of each package, so a pin that RPM Fusion has moved past fails `lock.py check` and the build until the pin is bumped.
  - When 580 becomes a legacy series, RPM Fusion renames the packages (`xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-580xx*`). That needs a change to the package list in `lock.py`, not only a version bump.
- **CI cost:** three image builds per cycle instead of one. The shared stages are cached layers, so only the GPU layer and the UKI assembly are paid three times.
- **Flatpak applications** need the NVIDIA GL runtime extension matching the host driver version (`org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia-<version>`). flatpak installs it when the host driver is present; the hardware check covers it.
- **Content drift of the base:** the digest pin plus a reviewed bump PR, with the package difference reported in the PR body.
- **Package sets differ from today.** base-atomic is not identical to `ermete-base-nvidia`. The first implementation task compares the two package sets in CI and lists every package the image loses or gains for review.

## 5. Out of scope

These defects were found on the same boot and each needs its own fix:

- `greetd.service.d/override.conf` is shipped by `athanor-scudo`. Its sandboxing is inherited by the whole graphical session, which sees read-only `/proc/sys` and cgroups, and rootless podman fails.
- Intel AX200 Bluetooth firmware load fails.
- `athanor-journal-seal.service` can never succeed, because Fedora's `journalctl` is built without FSS.
- `systemd-nsresourced` cannot load its BPF program.
- The `ddcutil` udev rule names a missing `i2c` group.
- `tmpfiles` writes into read-only `/usr` and into `/nix` before it is mounted.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

1. `athanor-system` builds on base-atomic, passes ISO acceptance, and contains no `nvidia*.ko` and no NVIDIA kernel argument.
2. `athanor-system-nvidia` and `athanor-system-nvidia-legacy` build, pass the S6 gate and the file checks of S8, and are signed and attested.
3. **Hardware check on the maintainer's desktop:** after `bootc switch` to `athanor-system-nvidia`:
   - `/dev/dri` lists a card and a render node for each NVIDIA GPU, driven by `nvidia-drm`;
   - `nvidia-smi` lists both GPUs;
   - both monitors run at native resolution;
   - `cosmic-panel` initialises EGL;
   - `modinfo -F signer nvidia` names the module signing key.

   After this check `MOK_PRIVATE_KEY` is deleted from the `signing` environment.

## 7. Migration of the maintainer's desktop

1. **Now, to use the desktop:** the temporary kernel argument `modprobe.blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_peermem` hands both GPUs back to `nouveau`.
2. **Once the variant is published:** `sudo rpm-ostree kargs --delete=modprobe.blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_peermem` and `sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/hr-mes/athanor-system-nvidia:latest`, then a reboot at the maintainer's choice.
3. The checks of section 6, item 3.

## 8. Changes owed by other documents

- **`doc_kernel_build.md` section 10:** the variant names become `athanor-system-nvidia` and `athanor-system-nvidia-legacy`. The modules still come from `nvidia-kmod.yml`; the userspace and firmware come from S4 and S5. Section 13 records this decision.
- **`doc_kernel_profile.md`:** "NVIDIA parameters and dracut configuration … apply only where an NVIDIA GPU is detected" becomes "… apply only in the NVIDIA image variants (doc_system_image.md, S4 and S5)". Section 14's note on `athanor-base-config` shipping NVIDIA configuration to every machine is resolved by S4.
- **`NEXT.md`:** the references to `ermete-base-nvidia` are replaced.
