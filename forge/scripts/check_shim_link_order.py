"""check_shim_link_order.py <elf>

gtk4-layer-shell works by interposing libwayland-client's symbols, so the dynamic linker
must load it before libwayland-client, and upstream asks for "before GTK as well". When
it does not, nothing fails: the surface silently becomes an ordinary window with a title
bar. The order of DT_NEEDED is the load order, and today it is right only by the accident
of how cargo orders its -l flags (spike P2). This check turns the accident into a
contract: it runs in %check and fails the package.
