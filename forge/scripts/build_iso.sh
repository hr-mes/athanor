# build_iso.sh IMAGE OUTPUT_DIR: installer ISO of a bootc image, built with
# bootc-image-builder.
#
# Not the osbuild/bootc-image-builder-action: the builder looks for the installer
# package list as <ID>-<VERSION_ID>.yaml, where ID comes from the os-release of the
# image being installed, and its search paths are compiled in. Athanor declares
# ID=athanor, which matches none of the definitions shipped inside the builder, so ours
# has to be mounted over that directory, and the action passes no volumes of its own.
#
# The builder reads the image from the root container storage and does not pull it, so
# this script does. The build configuration has no option of its own: the builder reads
# whatever is mounted at /config.toml. Its output belongs to root, hence the --chown.
