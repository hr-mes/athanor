# Checks that the registry probe in check_idempotency.sh tells its three answers apart,
# against images that really are and really are not in the registry.
#
# Run it from anywhere with skopeo available:
#   bash forge/scripts/check_idempotency_test.sh
#
# The case that matters is the first one. The probe used to pass --creds whenever a token
# was set, and a token the registry rejects makes skopeo fail with 403 even on an image
# anyone can read anonymously. That failure was read as "image absent", so every package
# rebuilt on every run: 47 nodes and 4.6 hours of runner time for a push that touched none
# of them. Anonymous first, credentials only as a fallback, and a registry that does not
# answer at all is an error rather than a silent rebuild.
