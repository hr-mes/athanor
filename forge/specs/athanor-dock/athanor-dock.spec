BuildRequires:  rust cargo gcc pkgconf-pkg-config gtk4-devel glib2-devel gtk4-layer-shell-devel binutils python3 gettext
# athanor-bar ships the vendor favourites, /usr/share/athanor/favorites.toml, that both read.
Requires:       gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell athanor-calmo athanor-bar

%description
One layer-shell surface per output, on the edge the user's layout document gives it:
the launcher, workspaces and application-library buttons and the running applications
with favourites, which a drag reorders. Visible, auto-hiding behind a strip on its
edge, or absent. Starts applications behind a Wayland security context, is confined
with Landlock, and falls back to the vendor layout after five failures in ten minutes.
Not enabled: until the switch of stage 2 the user enables athanor-dock.service by hand.

%changelog
* Tue Sep 29 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-3
- The dock of doc_bar.md, BR7, replacing the GTK 0.7 program of the same name, whose
  library now lives in the athanor-shell-rs workspace: one surface per output on the
  edge of doc_shell.md SH7, visible, auto-hiding or absent, with the launcher,
  workspaces and application-library buttons and the running applications with
  favourites that a drag reorders; applications started behind a security context;
  Landlock; a crash loop falls back to the vendor layout.

* Sun Sep 06 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-2
- Package the athanor-dock executable; the static rlib shipped before has no
  use outside the build

* Wed Aug 05 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-1
