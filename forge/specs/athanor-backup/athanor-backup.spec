Summary:        Hourly btrfs snapshots of /var/home with retention and restore

%description
Hourly read-only btrfs snapshots of the /var/home subvolume, kept in the
/var/home/.snapshots subvolume (root, 0700): the newest of each of the last 24
hours, 7 days and 4 ISO weeks that hold one. `athanor-backup restore` copies a
file or directory from a snapshot into ~/Ripristinati/<snapshot>/ as the home's
owner, never over the live files. Snapshots share blocks with the live data:
they protect against deletion and overwriting, not against a failed disk.

%changelog
* Thu Sep 24 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-5
- Rewrite for btrfs, the filesystem the image installs: the bcachefs ioctls never
  applied, the daemon ran as root with ProtectHome=yes and snapshotted /root, its
  restore deleted the live home, nothing activated it on the bus and its polkit
  actions were never declared, so every hourly tick failed.
- One root CLI replaces the D-Bus daemon and its bus policy: create, prune, list
  and restore. The hourly unit runs create then prune with only the snapshot
  subvolume writable. The unpackaged borg prototype is removed.
- Restore resolves the path beneath the snapshot without following symlinks and
  copies as the home's owner with --update=none-fail.

* Fri Sep 11 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-4
- The hourly snapshot trigger calls the daemon through busctl: dbus-send is not part
  of the image and the unit failed at every timer tick (status=203/EXEC).
* Sun Sep 06 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-3
- Build only this crate from the workspace; install the systemd units and the
  D-Bus policy from the crate directory instead of empty placeholder files
- Drop the athanor-backup-ui binary, which the crate never defined

* Wed Jul 15 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-1
- Initial release of athanor-backup Bcachefs CoW snapshot daemon and Time Machine GUI
- Automatic hourly snapshot creation via systemd user timer
- Instant single-click rollback and snapshot creation
