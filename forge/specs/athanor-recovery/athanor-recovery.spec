Name:           athanor-recovery
Version:        1.0.0
Release:        6%{?dist}
Summary:        Text console shown when the desktop does not start

License:        MIT
BuildArch:      noarch

Requires:       systemd util-linux greetd athanor-update

%description
When greetd fails three times in a minute, the desktop does not start. This package
then gives the person a text login on tty1 and a message, in English and Italian, that
says how to go back to the previous system version: `sudo athanor-update go-back`.
It carries the greetd drop-in that starts the console, the target, and the unit that
writes the message. The graphical kiosk it replaces is kept as source in the frozen
crate forge/specs/athanor-recovery/athanor-recovery-1.0.0, out of the workspace and the image.

%changelog
* Wed Sep 30 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-6
- The graphical kiosk leaves the image. It ran as an unprivileged user with
  NoNewPrivileges, so the rollback it ran (`rpm-ostree rollback`) could not do its work, and
  it would have bypassed athanor-update, which holds the digest a rollback leaves so that the
  timer does not undo it. Its fallback reported a bcachefs snapshot as a success, its
  diagnostics ("Integrity Tamper Detected", "Bcachefs") were fixed text, and nothing in it
  authenticated anyone.
- After the same trigger, greetd failing three times in a minute, the machine now gets a
  text login on tty1 with a message saying how to go back: `sudo athanor-update go-back`,
  which asks the service that owns the rollback, under polkit. The root account is locked,
  so the login is an administrator's.
- No binary, no crate build, no athanor-recovery user: sysusers.d and the PAM stack of
  the kiosk are no longer installed. The user of an existing machine stays.
* Thu Sep 24 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-5
- Declare the athanor-recovery system user in sysusers.d. The unit ran as a user no
  package created, so every fallback from a failed greetd died at the USER step and
  left a black screen.
- Give the kiosk a RuntimeDirectory for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR: /run/user belongs to root and
  the kiosk user could not create its own directory there.
- Run the kiosk in a logind session: PAMName=athanor-recovery with its own session
  stack, on VT1 where greetd was. Without a session cosmic-comp could not become DRM
  master nor open the input devices, so the kiosk could not draw.
* Sat Sep 19 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-5
- Build against gtk4 0.11 and relm4 0.11 (doc_shell.md, SH4). No source change was needed.
* Thu Sep 10 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - recovery on cosmic-comp
- Run the pre-boot recovery kiosk on cosmic-comp instead of cage, the same single-client
  way the greeter and the session do. cage is no longer needed anywhere, so it leaves the
  image entirely; one compositor across greeter, session and recovery.
* Sun Sep 06 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-3
- Build only this crate from the workspace; install the systemd units and the
  greetd drop-in from the crate directory instead of empty placeholder files

* Wed Jul 15 2026 Athanor Forge <forge@athanor.os> - 1.0.0-1
- Initial release of athanor-recovery Pre-Boot GUI Wayland Kiosk (`cage` + `athanor-recovery-ui`)
- Automatic isolation to athanor-recovery.target when greetd fails StartLimitBurst=3 times
- Visual 1-click rollback to Bedrock Stable Commit (`8aa3fd4`) and previous stable OSTree deployments
