# run_iso_test.sh ISO OUTPUT_DIR: installs the published Athanor ISO in a VM without a
# person at the keyboard, restarts into what was installed, and reports whether the
# greeter came up.
#
# The ISO is used exactly as published. The shipped installer is attended by design, so
# it stops and asks; the answers a person would give are supplied instead on a second
# disk carrying forge/test/iso/collaudo.ks, selected with inst.ks= on the kernel command
# line. Nothing inside the ISO is rewritten, which is the point: the artifact under test
# is the artifact that ships.
#
# Two phases in one QEMU life. The installer writes the disk and restarts; the firmware
# then finds the installed system because the ISO ejects itself and the disk is first in
# the boot order. Both phases talk on the same serial console, and the markers this
# script waits for are written by the kickstarts: "Install finished" by the builder's own
# and "Athanor kickstart finished" by ours.
#
# Everything the run learns goes to OUTPUT_DIR: the console log, the screenshots, and
# greeter.txt with the verdict. The screenshots are there to be looked at by a person,
# not only asserted on.

# The disk boots before the CD. On the first pass it is empty and therefore unbootable, so
# the firmware falls through to the ISO and the install happens; afterwards the disk holds
# a system and wins, which is how the machine reaches its own first boot inside the same
# QEMU life. With the CD first the guest reinstalls forever, which is what it did: the
# kickstart's `reboot --eject` does not persuade the firmware to skip a CD that is still
# attached and still first in the boot order.
# virtio-vga gives the guest a GPU its compositor can actually use. QEMU's default is a
# bochs VGA, whose DRM driver offers no GBM, so cage exits without a word and greetd logs
# "greeter exited without creating a session" three times before hitting its start limit
# (run 34290131076). The image already carries virtio-gpu.ko, libgbm and
# virtio_gpu_dri.so, so nothing has to be added to the product for this. virtio-vga rather
# than virtio-gpu-pci because it keeps a VGA framebuffer, which is what the screenshots
# read; a machine with no display device at all is also not what anyone installs onto.
