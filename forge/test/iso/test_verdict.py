"""Checks that the acceptance test reports what actually happened.

Run it directly: python3 forge/test/iso/test_verdict.py

Everything here guards against a quiet wrong answer. A virtual machine that will not boot
is loud and needs no test; what does not announce itself is a verdict that calls a broken
run green, a console that types the wrong thing at GRUB and leaves the installer waiting
for a person, a check that mistakes the installed system's own GRUB for a reinstall and
stops the run just as it was about to succeed, or a console that has its answer and keeps
waiting anyway, which is what turned a twelve-minute run into ninety.

So: the cases that decide a pass or a fail, the boot commands console.py sends, the
markers it recognises across chunk boundaries, when it stops, and the PNG conversion,
checked on the pixels rather than on the file existing.
