"""Turns what the run recorded into a pass or a fail, and into something readable.

Usage: verdict.py OUTPUT_DIR GREETER_WAIT QEMU_STATUS

Reads phases.txt, written by console.py, and the console log beside it. Prints a report
on stdout, writes the same report to OUTPUT_DIR/verdict.md for the job summary, and
exits non-zero when the run did not reach a desktop session.

Five things have to be true for a pass, and they are checked separately so a failure
says which part broke:

  installed        the ISO's own kickstart finished, so ostreecontainer wrote the image
  kickstart-done   our additions ran too, so the disk has an account on it
  greeter          the installed system reports a greeter session alive and steady
  session          after the password is typed at that greeter, the account's own
                   desktop session is alive and steady, shell and dock included
  settings         the settings application, started inside that session, is still
                   running twenty seconds later

The greeter is recognised from the console rather than from a screenshot, because a
screenshot cannot tell a drawn greeter from a wallpaper. The screenshots are still kept
and published: an automated check says the session started, a person looking at the
picture says it started *correctly*, and the second question is not one this script can
answer.
