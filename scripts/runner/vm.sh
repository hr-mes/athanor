# One job of the self-hosted runner (scripts/runner/README.md). Asks GitHub for a
# just-in-time runner configuration, boots the base image with snapshot=on (no write
# reaches it) and a scratch disk recreated empty, and passes the configuration to the
# guest as a systemd credential through fw_cfg. The job is over when GitHub removes the
# just-in-time registration: vm.sh then powers the guest off through QMP, whatever the
# runner inside does, and athanor-runner.service starts the next one. Runs as the
# dynamic user of the service: STATE_DIRECTORY holds golden.qcow2 and the disks, the
# GitHub token is the service credential github-token and never appears on a command
# line.
#
# Reaching the GitHub API is never allowed to end a running job: a DNS blip, a reset
# connection or a 5xx/429 is retried with backoff, and only a definitive 404 (the
# registration is actually gone) powers the guest off. See registration_status().
