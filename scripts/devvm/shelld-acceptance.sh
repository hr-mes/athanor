# Package 2b.1 of docs/architecture/doc_bar.md in the dev VM's real session, under the real
# unit file and the real user manager. COSMIC owns both org.freedesktop.Notifications and
# org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher in the VM's real session, so the daemon runs on a private
# bus of its own at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/athanor-shelld-acceptance-bus, a same-named
# .socket/.service pair (the image has no dbus-daemon, and dbus-broker-launch only runs
# under real socket activation), reached through a systemd drop-in on athanor-shelld.service.
# Deploys the binary and the unit from .scratch/shell-rig/bin and forge/specs/athanor-shelld
# (build the binary with forge/test/shell/rig.sh build-shelld). With no argument it runs
# every stage in order; with arguments, only those, in the order given. Prints PASS <stage>
# or FAIL <stage>: <what was read>, and exits non-zero on the first failure. Cleanup always
# runs on exit, through a trap, so a failed stage leaves no daemon or drop-in behind.
