# Unattended kickstart of the development VM (scripts/devvm/README.md). create.sh fills in
# @USER@ and @SSH_KEY@ and hands it to the published ISO the way the acceptance test hands
# over forge/test/iso/collaudo.ks: on a disk labelled ATHANORKS, named by inst.ks= on the
# GRUB command line. It follows collaudo.ks line for line except where a development VM
# differs from a one-shot test VM, and those lines say so.
#
# FOR THE DEVELOPMENT VM ONLY. The account has a password equal to its name and
# passwordless sudo, which is acceptable for a guest reachable only from the host
# (user-mode network, SSH forwarded on 127.0.0.1) and wrong anywhere else.

# The builder's own kickstart: the ostreecontainer line and the pinned `bootc switch`, so
# the VM runs exactly what the ISO installs.

# Anaconda writes a / line into /etc/fstab (subvol=root,compress=zstd:1,...,ro). On a
# composefs root that line can only fail: systemd-remount-fs.service tries to apply its
# options to the overlay mounted on /, the overlay refuses the reconfiguration, and the
# unit fails on every boot (Fedora Atomic SIG issue 72, rhbz#2348934, bootc issue 971).
# The root is mounted by the initrd from root= and rootflags= on the kernel command line,
# so the line is removed whatever the root file system is.

# A btrfs root loses compress=zstd:1 with that line, so the option moves to the kernel
# command line of this installation only; any other root file system gets nothing, since
# ext4 and xfs refuse the option and would not mount.
#
# The command must run without --sysroot. `ostree admin instutil set-kargs` then resolves
# the sysroot to /, which in this chroot is the deployment, and finds the deployment it
# has to edit by reading boot/loader.<bootversion>/entries -- the real /boot, which
# PrepareOSTreeMountTargetsTask bind-mounts into the deployment before the scripts run.
# Naming --sysroot=/sysroot instead fails: the same task binds the physical root there
# with a plain --bind (recurse=False), and a non-recursive bind does not carry the /boot
# mount of the physical root, so /sysroot/boot is an empty directory, ostree reads no
# bootloader entry and reports "Unable to find a deployment in sysroot". That aborted
# every install in ISO acceptance run 35280318314; it is reproducible outside an
# installer against any sysroot whose boot/ holds no loader entries. Anaconda's own
# ConfigureBootloader issues the identical call, chrooted into this same system root and
# without --sysroot (pyanaconda/modules/payloads/payload/rpm_ostree/installation.py,
# branch fedora-43).
#
# %post scripts run after that task: the boss queues RunScriptsWithTask(KS_SCRIPT_POST)
# in the configuration queue, which follows the installation queue carrying the payload's
# post-install tasks (pyanaconda/modules/boss/installation.py, branch fedora-43). So the
# arguments ConfigureBootloader wrote -- root=, rootflags=subvol=, rw -- are already on
# the deployment, --merge keeps them and appends this one, and the initrd's
# systemd-fstab-generator joins every rootflags=. Nothing rewrites the entries after the
# scripts. The arguments belong to the deployment, so bootc carries them into every
# later deployment.
