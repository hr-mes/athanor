# Vendored protocol descriptions

The COSMIC protocol descriptions this crate generates its bindings from, with
`wayland-scanner` at build time. They are copied unchanged from
[`pop-os/cosmic-protocols`](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-protocols) at commit
`c0cff4db14c37ed954983158e4055aa94c7741d9` (2026-09-11), path `unstable/<name>.xml`.
`SHA256SUMS` pins their content: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` in this directory.

The crates published from that repository (`cosmic-protocols`, `cosmic-client-toolkit`)
are GPL-3.0-only and this crate does not link them. Each description carries its own
licence in its `<copyright>` element:

To move to a newer commit: download the six files from that commit, check the licence
of each, update this table, the commit above and `SHA256SUMS`, then run the client's
tests and `forge/test/shell/rig.sh compositor-e2e`.
