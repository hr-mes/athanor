# Key-based signature of the published system images, and the verification a machine will
# make (docs/architecture/doc_update_trust.md, UT2). Runs in a job that holds the key and
# does nothing else: it reads the digests file the build job wrote, signs, verifies, ends.
#
# The signature must be the classic cosign attachment at <repo>:sha256-<hex>.sig, the only
# format containers/image reads, so it is made with `skopeo copy
# --sign-by-sigstore-private-key` and never with cosign 3, which writes a bundle every
# Athanor machine treats as no signature. Each image is then pulled through the policy
# rendered from this checkout (`skopeo copy --policy`), not checked with `cosign verify`:
# that also catches a wrong registries.d entry before a machine meets it.
#
# The key and its passphrase arrive in COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY and COSIGN_PASSWORD. skopeo takes
# both as files only, so they are written by the shell's own printf, under umask 077, into a
# private directory on tmpfs that is removed on exit, and the variables are unset before the
# first child process starts: neither value is ever on a command line, in a world-readable
# file, or in the environment of skopeo.
#
# Usage: sign-images.sh DIGESTS_FILE      (lines: "REPOSITORY TAG DIGEST", image-digests.sh)
# Environment: COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY, COSIGN_PASSWORD; SIGN_KEYS_DIR (default system/keys);
#              the registry login is the caller's business.
